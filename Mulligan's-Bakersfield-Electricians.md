Electricians were originally people who demonstrated or studied the principles of electricity, often electrostatic generators of one form or another.[2]

In the United States, electricians are divided into two primary categories: linemen, who work on electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltages, and wiremen, who work with the lower voltages utilized inside buildings. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV. Other sub-specialties such as control wiring and fire-alarm may be performed by specialists trained in the devices being installed, or by inside wiremen.

Electricians are trained to one of three levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master Electrician. In the US and Canada, apprentices work and receive a reduced compensation while learning their trade. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are contracted to follow apprenticeship standards for a period of between three and six years, during which time they are paid as a percentage of the Journeyman's pay. Journeymen are electricians who have completed their Apprenticeship and who have been found by the local, State, or National licensing body to be competent in the electrical trade. Master Electricians have performed well in the trade for a period of time, often seven to ten years, and have passed an exam to demonstrate superior knowledge of the National Electrical Code, or NEC.

Service electricians are tasked to respond to requests for isolated repairs and upgrades. They have skills troubleshooting wiring problems, installing wiring in existing buildings, and making repairs. Construction electricians primarily focus on larger projects, such as installing all new electrical system for an entire building, or upgrading an entire floor of an office building as part of a remodeling process. Other specialty areas are marine electricians, research electricians and hospital electricians. "Electrician" is also used as the name of a role in stagecraft, where electricians are tasked primarily with hanging, focusing, and operating stage lighting. In this context, the Master Electrician is the show's chief electrician. Although theater electricians routinely perform electrical work on stage lighting instruments and equipment, they are not part of the electrical trade and have a different set of skills and qualifications from the electricians that work on building wiring.

In the film industry and on a television crew the head electrician is referred to as a Gaffer.

Electrical contractors are businesses that employ electricians to design, install, and maintain electrical systems. Contractors are responsible for generating bids for new jobs, hiring tradespeople for the job, providing material to electricians in a timely manner, and communicating with architects, electrical and building engineers, and the customer to plan and complete the finished product.

Do I Need A Professional?

Electricians are highly skilled tradesmen. This is one of the trade professions where an apprenticeship is involved and required. An apprentice must work under the supervision of a licensed electrician for a specific period of time. The amount of time is determined by each licensing municipality.

Those that have chosen to become full-fledged, licensed electricians have gone through a ton of training and on the job work experience. They like what they do, take their work seriously and are genuinely concerned for the safety of their clients. The state licensing tests are grueling and time consuming.

These tests cover a wide range of areas pertaining to the field. Those taking the test must prove that they have proficient knowledge of electrical theory. They also need to know about local, state and national electrical and building codes.

You'd be foolish not to hire professional electricians for most projects. Trying to do extensive repairs yourself is both unwise and dangerous. Not only could you get electrocuted but you could cause your house to catch fire and kill your family. Electrical work is best left for professionals.

How Do I Choose?

Once you've compiled a list of local electricians, you'll need to start doing your homework. There are several ways for you to find the best ones in your area. It will take a little bit of time but will be well worth it.

Call your municipality's building code office. Give them the names of the electricians that you have found. Ask them if they are licensed through the county. Any that are not licensed should be immediately crossed off of your list. Those that are licensed are keepers.

Now, you will need to contact the Better Business Bureau. They help consumers resolve any problems they have with local businesses. The Better Business Bureau also gives the companies ratings which help consumers decide whether or not they want to work with them. Ask for each electrician's rating. Any of them that have had a lot of complaints should be crossed off the list.

Finally, contact the electricians that are left of the list. Explain the project completely and ask for an estimate. More than likely he will want to come out to the jobsite to give you a clearly written estimate. That's a good thing. Once you have received all of your estimates, you can select the best one.

The Estimate is High

Many electricians will give you a discounted rate. A lot of people will just pay what they are told to pay without even asking for a break. Believe it or not, most electricians will lower the bill just to get the work. Either way, it can't hurt to ask.

Why You Shouldn't Hire Electricians If You Don't Have A Buffer

Don't put on electricians when you don't have any money in the bank because you have no buffer and when your work drives up, which it usually does, you will be stuffed. Your staff wages is your biggest operational expense as an electrical contracting business. 

When you hire someone, you should be able to leverage it. That's how you get mega profit when there are electricians out there who are doing a job as good as you or better. That's positive.

So you need to max out your potential. You are going to be the best salesperson, representing your business across the board.

While doing this, you also have to be cautious of stepping into inefficient admin roles. You need to hire a Virtual Assistant to free up your time. It’s not a big deal because training is minimal for someone who is a master at it already. You don't have to train them a lot. When you hire a VA, they already know all the systems. They can type 50 billion times faster than you. You can get them to write your emails fast. You can hire VAs who are at the top of their game for a fraction of the amount because economy-to-scale it's really good wages for them, and when you hire locally you would be paying $50/hr for the same thing. Consider company culture and potential employee’s skill set when making a hiring decision.

When you are just starting out with your electrical contracting business, you might want to use these 7 ways to build a team with little or no money.

Offer Stock Options: If you are planning to build a scalable electrical contracting business then you might be able to offer stock options to early employees. This way they will be as invested as you in the success of the company.

Hire Apprentices: It’s always good to be able to mentor someone and pass on your skills, knowledge, and lifelong lessons to them. You can hire apprentices so that you can train them according to your style of working and later integrate them into your company.

Hire part-time contractors: Sometimes, when starting out, you might not be generating enough work to put someone on for a full-time week of 40 hours. So, you can consider putting someone on part-time. And as you get more work you might extend their working hours, if their work is up to the mark.

Defer compensation: You can also hire people who are already set in their life and don’t mind working for a deferred compensation, which means that they will be paid only once the business starts generating profits. It’s often used for hiring people on a commission basis in the sales position.

Exchange services: This might feel like travelling back a few centuries, but a barter system might work well for you. Suppose, if you need someone’s marketing chops for your business, and you don’t have the right money to pay for it, you can offer electrical services in exchange.

Work with family and friends: It’s always a good plan to start with a little help from family and friends. Every one of them might have a skill set that can help your electrical business to achieve new heights. Don’t feel shy to approach them.

Inspire others to join you: Well, as an electrical business owner, you are very much in a leadership role. And it demands of you to be able to inspire your team and make sure that things get done every day. So, if you aren’t able to inspire other people to join your business, then it’s time to introspect.
 
Why electricians need to give feedback to their employers

While talking to Mark Smith, we ended up discussing the importance of feedback and how it is a two-way street. Meaning that it should not just flow one way from the top to the bottom, but it should also flow from the bottom to the top. So there should be an honest and constructive exchange of feedback from not only employers to the employees but also from the electricians to the electrical business owners.

Mark Smith says that if you are an employee who is not happy at work, then don't throw your arms up and say, "I am going to leave." Rather talk to your employer about what do you need to do to make it better. Tell them, “Because right now I feel this way, so what do I need to do personally to become that person for you as an employer?” Don't assume that your employer knows everything that's going on. If you can't tell them, they can't change something. You can get as pissed off as you want, if your employer doesn't know about it then it won't get fixed. But if you communicate with them then sometimes it will get fixed there and then.
