Apprenticeship: Electrician apprenticeship programs generally last four to five years and include a minimum of 576 hours of classroom instruction and 8,000 hours of on-the-job training.

Licenses: Most states and municipalities require that electricians be licensed. They must pass an exam that tests knowledge of electrical theory, the National Electrical Code, and local electrical and building codes.

Electricians are a highly unionized profession. In fact, the percentage of workers who belonged to a union in 2018 was higher than that of workers in any other industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Electrician Skills & Competencies

Working as an electrician requires multiple skills, traits, and abilities:

Manual dexterity: An electrician must have good manual dexterity and eye-hand coordination.

Color vision: They must be able to identify wires by color, so normal color vision is critical.

Physical fitness and a good sense of balance: They may be on their feet all day and work at high elevations, in addition to routinely lifting objects that weigh up to 50 pounds.

Troubleshooting and analytical skills: They need to decide which device is the right one for testing a wide variety of problems and then figure out the best solutions.

Ability to work on a team: Many electricians work on crews with limited supervision.

Job Outlook

The job outlook for electricians is good. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of electrician jobs will increase by about 9%, or about as fast as the average for all occupations, between 2016 and 2026.

Experienced electricians also have many opportunities for advancement, which may or may not involve changing employers. For example, electricians can become supervisors, or, if they work in construction, project managers. An electrician can also become an electrical inspector for a municipality.

Work Environment

Electricians might work indoors in residential and commercial buildings or outdoors on construction sites, sometimes in inclement weather.

Working as an electrician can be uncomfortable and, at times, dangerous. Electricians work in cramped spaces and spend a lot of time standing or kneeling. They're prone to minor injuries, such as burns, shocks, and falls, so wearing protective clothing and equipment at all times is important.
 
Work Schedule

Electricians typically work full-time and may work overtime hours as necessary, sometimes working evenings and weekends. Self-employed electricians might opt to work longer hours in the interests of maintaining and growing their businesses.

Why You Need A Licensed Electrician For Electrical Wiring Services

For electrical wiring projects, large and small, it is imperative that a licensed electrician be called upon. In most states, hiring an electrical worker with a license is, in fact, the law. Incorrect electrical work may cause death or damage and destruction to property. And, the person trying to make the repair could wind up electrocuted. It's important not to mess around with this miraculous yet potentially hazardous power system.

Our expert Canton electricians at Anything Electric wouldn't say things like this to get you to call us. In fact, we just want you to call any licensed electrician if you need electrical work of any kind. Please don't do it yourself or try to get your brother or friend to do it for you unless they are licensed. Of course, we will be glad to help you with electrical wiring service or any other service you need.

An Electrician's Training For Electrical Wiring Service Work

An electrician who is licensed has been through extensive training. Apprentice training programs are a common way that these professionals acquire their knowledge. An apprenticeship typically lasts four years and is a combination of class time and working under the tutelage of a seasoned professional electrician who has had extensive experience.

Some time frame estimates state that 2,000 on the job hours and nearly 150 classroom study hours are required in order to complete the apprenticeship. Many apprentices begin with classroom study and then venture into the field with some knowledge under their tool belt. Once they are licensed, they are journeyman electricians.

Some of the things that they learn include reading blueprints, theory and history of electrics, math, building codes and safety measures. They will learn to measure, connect wires, test outlets and switches and how to install conduit.

Even after becoming certified and licensed, the journeyman must continue to upgrade their education throughout their career. Electrical work is constantly changing its parameters as new methodology occurs in the field. In some states, a bachelor's degree will dub these pros "master electricians" and they have to demonstrate superior knowledge to the NEC.
 
What's Involved In Electrical Wiring Work

Electricians design, install, and maintain electrical systems in homes. Many provide service to commercial or industrial businesses. The entire system is designed by the electrician before work ever begins. An electrical panel will be installed in order for the wiring to be connected to the service line and then be routed throughout the home or building. This all must be done correctly or the electrical system presents a safety and fire hazard.

An electrician may commonly rewire or install a dedicated circuit to power a hot-tub, hot water, or some other heavy appliance. The wiring has to be connected to the existing electrical system. Again, This must be done correctly or the electrical system presents a safety and fire hazard.

Unless you want to risk your house burning down, electrocuting yourself instantly, or harming a visitor or friend later, call a licensed electrician for your Canton electrical wiring needs.

Electricians vs Wiremen

Electricians are trade workers who install, maintain and repair electrical systems and equipment in homes, businesses, industrial complexes and for municipalities. Electrician jobs fall into a number of broad categories, such as outside lineman, inside wireman and residential wireman. Anyone engaged in the trade is referred to as an electrician, but while all wiremen are electricians; not all electricians are wiremen.

Electricians

All electricians are trained in the basics of the trade. They can read blueprints; troubleshoot electrical problems; install, maintain and repair electrical lines and equipment; and inspect electrical lines, systems and circuit breakers for code compliance. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates growth in the construction industry to fuel a strong 23 percent growth in new job opportunities for electricians through the decade.

Inside Wiremen

Inside wiremen are electricians who take the electrical lines installed by outside linemen, and distribute the power through interior spaces of commercial operations, such as businesses, factories and offices. They specialize in installing, maintaining and repairing control systems, lighting, electrical outlets, motors and other electrical equipment. They might install fire and security alarm systems, perform preventive maintenance and consult with building management to determine ways for electrical systems to operate more efficiently.

Residential Wiremen

Residential wiremen perform many of the same tasks as inside wiremen, but in residential environments such as single-family dwellings, apartment complexes and condominiums. They might install electrical lines in new construction, or maintain and repair electrical systems in existing homes. They install upgraded electrical wiring, residential alarm systems, computer network and other communication cables and energy management systems.

Training and Wages

Most electricians receive their training through a formal apprenticeship program. The time required to complete such training depends on the program. For example, the Inside Wireman Apprenticeship program offered by the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee requires five years to complete. Apprentices are paid a percentage of a journeyman's wages, which could range -- after initial training -- from $18 to $32 an hour as the training progresses. Percentages vary by program, and typically increase as the apprentice achieves greater levels of proficiency. Entry into the program generally requires a high school diploma or GED, and a passing grade in one year of high school algebra.

Is Your Licensed Electrician Up to Snuff?

Before hiring any electricity worker for electrician contractor jobs, make sure electrician credentials check out. This is true whether hiring a home electrical wiring electrician, commercial journeyman electrician, licensed electrical contractors, or any type electrical work provider regardless of work title.

Before discussing electrician contract specifics or signing electrician work orders, make sure that licensed electrical contractors considered for the job meet the following criteria:

Does the journeyman electrician, electrical contractor, or other electricity work provider meet local, state, and national requirements? Is he or she:

A licensed electrician or licensed electrical contractor, with a valid license?

Certified for the type home electrical wiring or other electricity work to be performed?

Properly insured to meet journeyman electrician insurance requirements?

Insured for the duration of the home electrical wiring or other electrical projects to be performed?

Is the licensed electrical contractor able to provide references?

Do licensed electrical contractor references check out?

Does the electrical work cost quote sound reasonable?

Is the electrical work cost quote comparable to what other licensed electricians in the area charge for the same type service? Note: be wary of licensed electrical contractors who charge considerably less then other area electricians for same type service. Never hire a licensed electrician based on electrical work cost alone. Business and home electrical wiring represents a potentially dangerous situation; best left in the hands of the most responsible and skillful electricity professional possible.

Does the electrical contractor or journeyman electrician guarantee their electrical work in writing?

Are the licensed electrical contractors knowledgeable about business and home electrical wiring codes, in addition to local, state, and national electricity codes and guidelines?

Do licensed electrical contractor candidates have a proven track record for adhering to all electricity codes?

Is the licensed electrician adept at preparing well-detailed electrician contract and electrician work orders?

Do the licensed electrical contractors perform free pre-worksite inspection services, to provide an electrical work cost bid?

Has the journeymen electrician or licensed electrical contractor recently performed electrician contractor jobs similar to the type electrical projects he/she will be working on?

Is the licensed electrician bonded for the electrician contractor jobs they perform? Note: a bonded journeyman electrician, though not necessarily a requirement, is a definite plus! Bonded electrician contractor jobs offer a type of insurance policy for the electrical work project owner. Bonding helps to insure that the journeyman electrician or electrical contractor will meet his/her electrical work obligations in an acceptable manner. That all electrician contractor jobs will be completed to the satisfaction of the local wire inspector. And that business and home electrical wiring and other local, state, and national electricity codes and guidelines, will be strictly adhered to.

Finally, check to discover if the licensed electrician you are about to hire has any legitimate unresolved complaints lodged against him/her. Whether for unethical work principles, poor workmanship, or uncompleted electrician contractor jobs?

Connect with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to ensure that candidates being considered for electrician contractor jobs are licensed electrical contractors in good standing. Make certain insurance requirements are met, for the state in which the electrician contractor jobs will be completed. Also check to see whether there exist legitimate or unresolved complaints.

Once you have ascertained these things and selected the journeyman electrician or electrical contractor of choice, you are ready to focus on electrician work orders or electrician contracts. Note: an electrician work order or electrician contract becomes a binding and legal agreement only after it has been signed by the parties involved. In addition to making sure the electrician work order agreement or electrician contract is detailed and complete, be sure it gets signed by both the electrical projects owner and licensed electrician.

An electrician is any skilled tradesperson who designs, installs, maintains, and repairs the electrical systems and products used in residential homes, businesses, and factories. Electricians work inside or outside buildings to ensure lights, industrial equipment, and appliances operate safely and reliably. There are many special types of electricians, including residential electricians, who install wiring and solve electrical problems in homes, and inside electricians, who maintain and repair control systems, motors, and electrical equipment in businesses and factories.

Electrician Contracts and Electrician Work Orders

Various electrician contract forms and electrician work order samples are available over the Internet; free or reasonably priced. Conduct an online search using the phrases â€œfree electrician contract formsâ€ â€œelectrician work orderâ€, â€œsample electrician work ordersâ€, or â€œelectrician contractsâ€ for multiple options.

For less complicated electrical projects such as a home electrical wiring outlet update, lengthy electrician contract forms are not necessary. Signed electrician work orders usually suffice. But if business or home electrical wiring needs are complex or extensive, and for construction purposes, a detailed electrician contract form is best.

Licensed electrician contracts should:

Clearly and precisely outline business or home electrical wiring job requirements.

Include electrical work cost for labor.

Include a detailed electrical work materials list.

Include electrical work cost for materials.

Include a projected timeline for significant completion dates, in addition to the date when all electrician contractor jobs will be completed.

Both parties should carefully read electrician contracts before adding their signature. Verbal agreements or promises not clearly outlined within the contract are not legally binding. Vague references are open to interpretation and are worthless for contract purposes. And remember, even detailed electrician contract forms are not binding unless signed by both the electrical work project owner and licensed electrician.

Only then do they offer viable legal protection.
