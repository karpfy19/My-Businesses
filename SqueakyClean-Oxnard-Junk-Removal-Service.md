How Does Junk Removal Work?

Whether you’re moving, renovating, or just looking to get rid of extra stuff in your house, junk removal companies can help you do it. These types of companies specialize in taking unwanted items off of your hands quickly and efficiently. Many of them even take it a step further and in addition to hauling away your junk also make sure that all salvageable items are donated to appropriate charities. Working with junk removal companies is a great way to clear out your space, and can also take a lot of the guesswork out of how you’re going to get rid of all those unwanted belongings ahead of your move.

The average American generates about 4.5 pounds of waste every day, and that’s not even considering the things in your home that you’ve held on to for a while but no longer have a use for. If you think that you might be able to benefit from junk removal services, read on to learn everything you need to know about working with a junk removal company, including what types of services they offer, how much it typically costs, and what happens to all your stuff once it’s hauled away.

What is Junk Removal?

We always recommend getting rid of as much as you can prior to your move, and junk removal companies are a highly efficient way to do it.

Junk removal is a service that helps you get pretty much all kinds of trash removed from your home or office space. These services are often available on demand, meaning you can call a junk removal company and they’ll come haul away your stuff on the very same day (though you can also make an appointment ahead of time if you don’t want to risk it).

Typically, junk removal companies will provide you with two options for getting rid of your stuff:

Truck hauling. If you choose this service, the junk removal company will arrive at your location with a large truck fitted with a dumpster in the back. They’ll haul your junk onto the truck’s dumpster and then drive it all away as soon as they’re done. This option is excellent for post-renovation clean-ups and other times when all of your trash is already piled up and ready to go.

Dumpster rental. With dumpster rental services, a junk removal company will drop off a dumpster in your preferred size at your location. You fill it up at your leisure and then when you’re done they’ll return to pick it up and haul it away. This option is a good choice if you’re going to be clearing out your space over the span of a couple of days or if you’re undertaking a home renovation project.

What Will Junk Removal Companies Take?

If you need to get rid of it, chances are that a junk removal company will take it off of your hands (caveats to that are listed in the next section). This includes:

Large and small appliances

Air conditioner

Furniture

Mattresses

Computers, monitors, TVs, and other electronics

Exercise equipment

Bicycles

Tools

Construction debris (roofing materials, old carpeting, etc.)

Yard waste

Hot tubs and spas

Boxes

Books, toys, and other miscellaneous home items

Musical instruments, including large items like pianos

Clothing

The less stuff that you have to move, the smoother your move will go. Go through each room, closet, and drawer and separate out the items that you no longer want or need. It will be a lot easier to get rid of things when you know that you have a junk removal company ready to come pick it all up for you.

What Won’t Junk Removal Companies Take?

As for what junk removal companies won’t take, it’s basically the same as what professional moving companies won’t take since these items are dangerous to transport and need to be properly disposed of. This includes:

Opened cans of paint

Chemicals and solvents

Gasoline

Asbestos

Oil drums and oil tanks

Any other kind of toxic and/or hazardous waste

These types of corrosive, combustible, reactive, and toxic materials need to be disposed of according to the specific laws of your county. Check out our article on how to dispose of hazardous waste before you move for guidance.

What Do Junk Removal Companies Do With the Stuff They Take Away?

In terms of what happens with your junk, it depends on what it is and the junk removal company that you’re working with. Most junk removal companies today aim to protect the environment and give back to their communities by ensuring that any and all salvageable junk ends up with those who can benefit from it, instead of in a landfill. In these cases, things like furniture, clothing, toys, and linens that are in good condition will be brought to local shelters and relief groups who can put them to use.

When you’re choosing a junk removal company, be sure to ask them what happens to the items that they pick up. And if you have a choice between companies, opt for the one that goes out of their way to reduce waste and donate your items—it’s a much better alternative to simply dumping your items in a trash pile, especially those items that someone else can still get a lot of use out of.

How Much Does Junk Removal Cost?

Just like moving companies, junk removal companies can’t offer set prices or give you a fixed estimate over the phone. That’s because the cost of junk removal services depends on a number of factors, including how much junk you have to be hauled away and the type of materials that you need removed, where you live, and how accessible the job is (i.e. will they have to go up and down a set of stairs with your junk? Will they be able to park in a convenient location?). You’ll also pay a different price depending on whether you opt for a traditional junk haul or a dumpster rental.

Still, there are some benchmarks for junk removal pricing. According to HomeGuide, the average amount that people spend for junk removal services is between $150 and $350, though prices can range from about $70 to $750. Most junk removal companies price their services according to how much space you fill up in the truck. The more space you need, the more you can expect to spend.

To get the most accurate price, ask if you can get an on-site quote. Seeing your inventory of junk in person will allow a junk removal service provider to get as close of an idea as possible about how much truck/dumpster space you’re going to require.

Choosing a Junk Removal Company

There are a lot of junk removal companies out there. To choose the one that’s best suited to your needs, we recommend choosing and comparing between at least three different providers based on availability and pricing. This way, you’ll be able to make sure that you end up working with the company that’s going to offer you the best service at the best price.

As always, it’s a good idea to look at the reviews when hiring a junk removal company. This way, you’ll be able to learn about past customers’ experiences with the company and whether they would recommend working with them. You’ll also get some additional insight into their reliability and equipment.

Junk removal companies offer a great option for getting rid of things before your move. If you’ve got stuff to haul away, save yourself the time and trouble and bring on junk removal experts to do the job.

Hazardous Waste

One of the most significant challenges to waste management and junk removal is hazardous waste. The EPA defines “hazardous waste” as “Waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment.” These materials are banned from landfills and cannot be picked up by the average trash company or junk removal company. Instead, they need to go to special facilities where they can be stored, treated, and disposed of safely.

For instance, the leachate produced at landfills is considered a hazardous waste, which is why it needs to be pumped out of the landfill and transported to an alternative site for treatment and disposal. Many other items and materials can qualify as hazardous waste, including batteries, gasoline, sludge from wastewater treatment, and many materials used in manufacturing.

The good news is that the average homeowner or business owner won’t be dealing with hazardous waste regularly. A company that does petroleum refining or pesticides manufacturing will produce plenty of hazardous waste and will need a strategy in place to dispose of it. When it comes to decluttering and removing junk from your home, though, items that qualify as hazardous waste are going to be few and far between.

With that said, some household items are hazardous waste. Typically, these materials will fall into one of four categories: corrosive, explosive, flammable, or poisonous. The containers or items that fall into these categories should be labeled or marked accordingly. Cleaning products, varnishes, motor oil (or other automotive fluids), pesticides, herbicides, and paints all qualify as hazardous waste and should not be thrown away in a trash bin or dumpster.

Ocean and Near Earth Orbit Junk

Not all junk ends up in landfills or hazardous waste dumps. Despite the best intentions of legislators and environmental advocacy groups, there are still massive collections of refuse in other places, including the ocean and outer space.

Unsurprisingly, junk in the ocean is a substantial concern. While an “ocean junkyard” might seem like the kind of dystopian concept you would read about in a science fiction novel, it’s indeed a real thing. The so-called “Great Pacific Garbage Patch” covers roughly 618,000 square miles and consists of 79,000 tons of plastic. Also known as “trash island,” this gigantic patch of garbage is made up of plastic that has been blown, dumped, or otherwise deposited into the sea over the years. Oceanic currents sweep the trash around the ocean and move it toward a “convergence zone” where the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is located.

There are abundant problems or potential problems caused by this plume of plastic. The most pressing is the impact it might be having on aquatic life. Animals can become entangled in the plastic and struggle to escape or die trying. Fish, birds, and other wildlife mistake pieces of plastic for prey ingesting the pieces of garbage and often dying as a result. Furthermore, as photodegradation breaks down the plastic components, dangerous chemicals can leach out into the water and affect the aquatic ecosystem.

There is an obvious question to ask here: why don’t we scoop up all that plastic and get it out of the ocean? Famously, Captain Charles Moore, who discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, said that any effort to clean up the trash “would bankrupt any country and kill wildlife in the nets as it went.” Because the plastic components are all loose, rather than being clumped together, they are challenging to collect in any efficient fashion. As the different pieces of plastic break down, the challenges of cleaning up this patch compounds even further. Some of the debris is big, but some of it is microscopic. Even if you managed to collect all the big pieces, there would still be environmental risks due to all the smaller bits of plastic.

Organizations are looking at potential cleanup options, such as the Ocean Cleanup Foundation. Any such effort will take many years and could require technological innovations that we don’t have yet. In the meantime, most experts agree that the best thing to do for now is to educate people about what plastic does to the environment. By encouraging people to cut down on the plastics they use in their day-to-day lives, exercise reuse strategies where possible, and properly recycle or dispose of plastics, we can at least prevent the Great Pacific Garbage Patch from growing.

As for space junk, most of that comes from either natural sources (such as meteoroids) or human-made sources (debris from spacecraft, launch vehicle stages, nonfunctional satellites, and more). Unlike with oceanic junk, the average person’s day-to-day habits have no impact on how much space junk is orbiting the planet. However, there is still a lot of junk—some 500,000 pieces, according to NASA—and it poses a threat to spacecraft and satellites. It’s also worth noting that this junk could impact the average person’s life. So much of what we do as humans relies on satellites, from communication to GPS navigation to live TV broadcasts. Even losing a single satellite due to space junk could have a noticeable impact on millions of people.

There is also a longer-term threat here. Within the next few centuries, it is predicted that the wall of space junk around the Earth will become virtually impossible to traverse. In effect, this occurrence would trap humanity on Earth, rendering space missions impossible. If there were a situation where our descendants needed to leave the planet for life elsewhere, they would have to get through the space junk first.

Currently, there is no agreed-upon method for cleaning up the planet’s space junk problem. There have been some proposals, from “space nets” (to capture the debris) to lasers (to knock them out of orbit). However, the cost of any such system would be remarkably high. So far, no government or company has volunteered to bear that cost.

The (Terrestrial) Junk Removal Process

No junk removal company can help with the space junk problem… at least, not yet. For now, though, working with a junk removal business can yield plenty of benefits for the average consumer.

As we already mentioned, “junk removal” is a term typically used to describe a particular branch of the waste management industry. Junk removal companies are not the garbage companies that come to your home or business weekly to collect your trash. Instead, they are the people who you call when you have a large-scale project that involves either a significant amount of trash or big, heavy, and unwieldy junk items.

Also mentioned at the top of this page, junk removal breaks down into two categories: full-service junk removal and dumpster rental. With a full-service junk removal, you are hiring people to come into your home or business and haul your trash out to their dumpster truck. This option might be attractive if you are dealing with particularly hard-to-maneuver items (couches, appliances, mattresses, etc.) or would prefer not to do the heavy lifting.

With a dumpster rental, you have a DIY project on your hands. The junk removal company delivers a dumpster, and you fill it on your own time. This option is preferable if you want to save money, if you haven’t organized your junk removal process ahead of time, or if you are doing something like a renovation, where you need to have a continually available spot to dispose of debris.
