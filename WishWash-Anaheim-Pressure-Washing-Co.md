Maintaining your home and business with regular pressure washing can greatly increase the longevity of your property. Our fully insured / skilled technicians come prepared with the very best in professional equipment and products to tackle any of your power and pressure washing needs.

It’s tough to get excited about outdoor cleaning projects when you’d rather be at the lake or on the golf course. Fortunately, the right time-saving tools can help you squeeze both your around-the-house tasks and recreational activities into a single weekend. Refreshing a dirty deck, cleaning mold from patio furniture, removing packed mud from tire wells—all these can be done more quickly and efficiently when you break out a pressure washer. This handy machine uses up to 80 percent less water than the average garden hose while packing more than 50 times the power!

But not all pressure washers are equal, nor is one suitable for every outdoor chore. And it’s important to use this tool properly to ensure satisfying, damage-free results. Whether you’re in the market for a powerful, game-changing cleaner or you already have one in your home-care arsenal, make note of these best and worst practices so you can be sure to get the most from this lean, mean cleaning machine.

DO Prep Before Starting

Without an adequate water supply, your pressure washer will fall short of your expectations for efficiency. First, test the water flow from your hose by timing how long it takes to fill a five-gallon bucket. If it takes two minutes or less, you’re good to go; longer than that indicates that there’s not enough water flow to operate the washer. Once you’ve determined that you have sufficient water flow to feed your pressure washer, clean out its inlet filter and check that the connections are secure wherever the tool attaches to a hose or accessory, such as the twist-on Pivot Nozzle Wand from Hyde Tools, which facilitates easy maneuvering during cleaning chores.

DON’T Underestimate Its Power

A pressure washer’s biggest strengths—speed and power—make this tool as dangerous as it is efficient. Case in point: The water stream from even those models with psi’s on the lower side is forceful enough to cut through human skin! Save yourself and your property from harm by putting on safety goggles, gripping the wand tightly to avoid recoil when the pressure kicks in, and starting on the lowest pressure setting. Work in sweeping motions so that you’re never concentrating the tool’s power in one place for too long—and always aim the nozzle away from people, pets, and your prize peony bush.

DON’T Use One Nozzle Tip for Every Job

You can fit a pressure washer with a variety of nozzles that produce everything from wide-spray patterns to narrow streams so you can better harness the water for the job at hand. Rule of thumb: The more narrow the spray, the more force it delivers. A wide, 40-degree nozzle works well for general washing, such as loosening dirt on redwood or cedar decking, cleaning siding, and rinsing outdoor furniture. A 25-degree nozzle tip will tackle dirt and grime on concrete and other types of masonry. Zero- or 15-degree nozzle tips concentrate intense pressure on a small area, making them most useful for removing stubborn stains from iron.

DO Adjust Your Spray’s Angle for Best Force

When stubborn stains require maximum cleaning power, you want to keep the pressure washer’s nozzle perpendicular to the grimy surface. Sounds easy enough, right? Well, it is—until you need to reach the underside of a patio table or the siding along the top of a house. Fortunately, the problem-solving Pivot Nozzle Wand from Hyde Tools eliminates the need to bend or overextend for these harder-to-reach areas. Each of its models—the 18-inch wand for electric pressure washers and the 28-inch one for the heavier-duty, gas-powered machines—features extra control via an adjustable nozzle. A simple twist of the handle rotates the spray within a 90-degree angle so you can direct the force of your pressure washer’s stream over, under, or around any dirty object. No more squatting, stretching, or straining to achieve the appropriate spray angle.

DO Ease Into the Job

A blast that is too direct can damage even those surfaces you’d expect to hold up well to a washing, so you always want to start with a light touch. Take, for instance, siding: Pressure washers excel at cleaning most types, but stand too close and you risk blasting off some of the paint or ruining softer wood like cedar. For best results in pressure-washing, position yourself 10 feet away from the surface you’re cleaning, turn on the water, then step forward until the spray is just forceful enough to remove dirt.

DON’T Use a Pressure Washer for Everything

Even with extreme care and lowest pressure, not all items are suitable for pressure-washing, particularly if they already show signs of wear and tear. For example, while most automobile paint jobs can withstand strong spray, a thin clear coat or scratched exterior should be cleaned using lower water pressure. To tackle this and other similar outdoor chores, disconnect the pressure washer from your garden hose and swap in a HYDE PivotPro™ Water Wand, which features a detergent reservoir and an adjustable nozzle to save you from unnecessary exertion and back-bending contortions. Plus, different PivotPro™ models come equipped with handy, interchangeable brushes attached to the front end. The Boat & Auto kit includes a soft-bristle brush, a spindle brush for cleaning wheel rims, and a microfiber-pad that will pamper your car’s exterior while you remove dirt and road grime.

DO Master the Correct Washing Technique

Caked-on gunk comes off more easily if you first soak the surface, with or without detergent, and let it sit for a few minutes. When using detergent, wet from the bottom up, using sweeping horizontal strokes to prevent streaks caused by runoff. To rinse, do the opposite, working from the top down so you don’t miss any cleanser.

POWER WASHERS VS. PRESSURE WASHERS

Ask anyone off the street if power washing and pressure washing are the same thing and they will likely shrug and answer, "yes." Ask any professional in the industry if these two are the same and you will hear a much different answer. This is important because, as a consumer, if you sign up for one of these you should understand what it is you are getting.

Not to mention by understanding the difference you will have an idea of which one might be right for you. Don't make a decision based on just what you think you are getting or what some salesperson says. Do your research and be a wise and informed consumer.

Different And The Same

One reason the average person assumes that pressure and power washing are one in the same is that they both essentially use water in order to achieve the same final result. A power washer, as the name implies, is known for supplying a powerful stream of hot water at a steady flow. The higher velocity makes it decent for cleaning and even in more complex situations such as removing gum from surfaces or killing moss.

On the other hand, in some situations it is thought that the high velocity may be too much and not appropriate. For instance, many professionals now believe power washing is not the best approach for cleaning roofing because it can get under shingles and tear them away. Plus, water can get under materials, like shingles, and cause mildew or mold.

Generally, the main difference in pressure washing is that the velocity is less and the temperature is cooler if not cold altogether. This makes pressure washing ideal for cleaning surfaces such as walkways, patios and materials like concrete or brick. So how can you be sure you are making the right choice?

Making Sense Of It All

Because the terms have become so interchangeable, even industry experts tend to use one term even if they mean the other. Make it a point to clarify which you are getting, especially if you have been told not to use power washing for certain materials on the exterior of your home. Otherwise, either one is a great way to clean up a surface that would be impossible to do any other way.

In some instances, it is mainly the time that is saved by using a higher pressure water washing system as opposed to another method. This high-pressure mechanical sprayer can be used to remove more than just dirt. For instance, many professionals rely on this for cleaning up buildings or vehicles and removing old paint or rust.

There are different nozzles that can be used which makes a difference in the stream. And the right choice of washer may be used for industrial jobs while a less extreme version is ideal for use even within the interior confines of a home. Washers can damage surfaces, forcing water deep into masonry and wood which can create a prolonged drying time or cause actual damage.

Other Things To Know

Keep in mind that there is also a difference between the system you rent from your local home improvement store and what a professional may use who comes out to clean your home. People often rent or buy their own and are then disappointed with the results they get. A pressure washer is the equivalent of a stronger garden hose so if you have a lot of mildew to remove for your siding, this may not get the job done.

There is also a difference in performance based on the manner in which the washer is fueled. The types of machines range from electric or diesel to gas or hydraulic. Of course using a soapy additive is another way to have better results, just make sure you rinse with pure, clean water following the wash.

It is of course important to use caution when using a washer, especially around electricity. When in doubt, hire a trained and experienced pressure washing professional to get the job done. The benefit is that they will already have all the necessary equipment and will get the job done right, the first time around. Make the most of your cleaning project by using a pwer or pressure washer to get the job done.

Direct Drive vs Belt Drive

Direct Drive Pumps

A "Direct Drive" pump has a hollow shaft, which simply slides onto the drive shaft of a motor or engine. The flange on the pump is mounted to the face of the engine or shaft end of the motor. Normal gasoline engine speed is about 3450 RPM. Since the pump is connected directly to the engine shaft, the pump RPM is the same as the engine RPM. Electric motors typically will turn a direct drive pump at 3450 RPM or 1725 RPM. Direct drive pumps allow for a more compact designed pressure washer. Another advantage is that this drive system is simple, with fewer moving parts; therefore less expensive. The disadvantage is by having the pump spin as much as the engine or motor, the bearings and other parts get more wear and tear, reducing the life span of the pump. Direct drive pressure washers transfer the vibration of the engine or motor directly to the pump. Also, the faster pumps of direct drive pressure washers are spinning so fast that they cannot draw water from a tank very well. However, they tend to work just fine when the water is forced into the pump, like when it is hooked-up to a hose.
 
Benefits of Direct Drive:

Compact Design

Lower Acquisition Cost

Disadvantages of Direct Drive:

Reduced Life Span

Cannot Draw Water from Tank or Standing Water Source

Belt Drive Pumps

A "Belt Drive" pump has a pulley mounted to its solid shaft and is driven by one or more belts that are attached to a pulley on the motor or engine. The pulley system allows these pumps to turn at a much lower RPM than a direct drive pump (typically 900-1400 RPM). The belt drive pump crankcase has a larger oil capacity. This, combined with the lower RPM of the belt drive pump, allows the pump to run much cooler than a direct drive pump. The pump is isolated from the heat of the engine or motor, also. Belts and pulleys also absorb vibration, reducing pump fatigue. Because of these factors, most heavy use pressure washer applications will demand a belt drive pump. The disadvantage of this system is there is some loss of efficiency due to the additional friction from the belts and pulleys. Plus maintenance is required occasionally to adjust the belts. However, all other things being equal, the belt drive system should provide for the longest pump life.

Benefits of Belt Drive:

Vibration Absorption

Lower RPM

Lower Operating Temperature

Longer Life

Disadvantages of Belt Drive:

Loss of Efficiency

More Maintenance Required

Pressure Washing Your Home Before Listing for Sale

Are you contemplating putting your home on the market this spring? Do you want to increase your odds of selling your home quickly? Do you want to impress buyers who are looking for a new home? If you answered yes to these questions, then you need to get your home power washed before you put it on the market.

Curb appeal is such an important part of selling your home and attracting potential buyers. Today’s home buyers are looking for properties that are not only convenient to shopping and have other nicely maintained homes in the neighborhood, but they want a property that they can literally just move into without a lot of work or hassle. If you think about it from their perspective, it totally makes sense! Moving is a lot of work. Anything you can do to help make your home look ready-to-go will help to make the sale.

Outdoor appeal is the one item that will get buyers in to take a closer look. A professional pressure wash will help to remove mold and mildew on your home’s surfaces, giving it a fresh, clean look. Cleaning siding is just one area that you can take advantage of. By having the siding professionally pressure washed, any dirt or mold or mildew that may be growing in it will be removed, restoring your home’s siding to a like-new condition.

Another area you can have cleaned is your roof. Over time, roofs can develop black streaks that are as a result of a form of algae that feeds off of your roof materials. Not only is this bad for your roof, but it is unsightly. Before you put your home on the market, have your roof cleaned, which will restore the shingles and let buyers know that you have cared for your home and there is no reason to anticipate needing a new roof anytime soon.
