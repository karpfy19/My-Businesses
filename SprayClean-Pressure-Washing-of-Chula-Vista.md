 Pressure Washer Hose Fittings, Couplers and Adapters
 
This guide will teach you everything you need to know about pressure washer hose fittings, couplers and adapters.

All the different types, sizes, materials and naming conventions used.

What the different fittings, couplers and adapters help you do (with 4 examples).

And how to select the correct one for your setup.

A pressure washer fittings connects pressure washer parts. It fits between the high pressure hose and trigger gun or between the pump and pressure hose to make them connect properly.

Your pressure washer will come with the fittings, couplers and adapters needed to make it work out-of-the-box (99% of the time).

You will only start to need fittings when you:

Want to add attachments (surface cleaner, foamer, pressure gauge)

Want to use a different high pressure hose (or extend the length of the one you have)

Want to turn screw fittings to quick connect

Want to better avoid hose kinks by using swivel fittings.

Fittings are inexpensive ($5 to $15), long lasting and are to make your life easier. There’s hundreds of different fittings to choose from, but only a couple of types you need to know about.

Fittings, Couplers, Adapters 

Fittings, couplings and adapters can be considered the same thing. Sometimes a website will refer to the entire category of connectors as fittings and then specific types of fittings as couplers or adapters or reducers. But it’s confusing and we won’t do that here.

However, we will talk about quick connect fittings and swivel fittings separate.

Quick Connect Fittings

Quick connect fittings turn screw connections to quick connect/release making the job of connecting and removing the hose fast and easy.

Female quick connect hose fittings (sometimes called sockets) have an o-ring to prevent leaks. The male side (the bottom one in the picture) are sometimes called the plug.

These days most hoses will come with QC connections out-of-the-box.

Swivels

Swivels stop the hose from kinking when in use and help to unkink it when you first walk out the hose.

It works by allowing swivel (spinning) of the hose without you having to twist the spray gun and extension wand in big circles. You can just walk it out and the gun swivel twists out the hose kinks as you walk. It’s one of those fittings you can’t pressure wash without once you try it.

Consider what a fitting must do:

It has to be strong enough to withstand 1000 – 4000 psi over (most likely) thousands of cycles use

It needs to firmly connect the parts together and not break despite the constant tugging by the user

It needs to be corrosion resistant since its water within, and

It has to be cheap enough to make them a profitable product for business.

Brass, plastic and stainless steel are the most common material used in pressure washer hose fittings.

Brass is the most common. Then plastic (there’s lots of residential electric pressure washers out there). Then stainless steel (very common in professional use due to chemical resistance).

Let’s look at the pros and cons of each:

Plastic

Plastic fittings will only be used for lighter-duty electric pressure washers.

Pros – Cheap. Light.

Cons – Prone to cracking and damage.

Brass

Brass is by far the most common fitting material for pressure washers. It is an alloy of copper and zinc and with its low melting point is easy to cast and machine.

Pros – Strong. Corrosion resistant. Easy to machine to different shapes. More affordable than stainless steel.

Cons – More expensive than plastic.

Stainless Steel

Stainless steel has added chromium to prevent rust.

Pros – Best for corrosion resistance. Chemical resistant. High strength.

Cons – Expensive.

Rubber O-rings

O-rings are used in the female fittings to prevent leaks. The quick connect male fits into the female socket and the o-ring is the perfect size to prevent leaks.

The main confusion when buying fittings is the size you need to get.

Is it the inside or outside diameter you measure?

Do you include the thread in that measurement?

How precise do you need to be?

Even with digital calipers it can difficult. Some fittings are 3/8″, some are 22mm, some are 14mm on the inside diameter (some need to be 15mm), sometimes you’ll find fittings going off British pipe thread standards and some are labelled QC F or QC M to confuse.

Let’s take a deeper look what all the size mean on fittings.

How to Measure Connections and Fittings

To proper measure the fitting you need will require calipers. A measuring tape will work but it won’t be as good because we are talking about 1mm differences.

Here are the best calipers:

Here are some other things to know about when talking power washer adapters:

Male (M)  vs. female (F) connections

The male side has a pin or plug that is inserted in the female socket or hole. The female fittings receives and holds the male connector in place.

NPT vs. BPT/BSP pipe thread standards

NPT = National Pipe Thread. U.S. technical standard for screw threads.

BSP = British Standard Pipe. British technical standard for screw threads.

Why should you care about NPT and BSP?

Because sometimes a pressure washer coupler will be NPT and sometimes it will be BSP. They don’t mesh together.

For example: a 3/8″ pipe size according to NPT has a thread pitch of 0.05555 inches (1.411mm) and an outer diameter of 0.675 inches (17.145mm). That same 3/8″ pipe according to BSP has a thread pitch of 0.0526 inches (1.337mm) and outer diameter of 0.6560 inches (16.662mm).

They are close but not exact and you won’t be able to turn a 3/8″ male NPT screw connection onto a 3/8″ female BSP connection more than a 3 or 4 turns before it locks up.

Internal vs. external diameter

When measuring you’ll need to be mindful of both the internal and external diameters of the fitting. M22 screw connections on gas pressure washers will have 14mm internal diameter but the same M22 on an electric will have 15mm ID.

The Different Sizes You’ll See: M22 Threads, 3/8″ Threads and Quick Connects

The main fitting sizes seen are pictured below with digital calipers to show their dimensions.

M22 threads are common on pumps, hoses and spray guns

The outer diameter is 22mm, the inner diameter is 14mm and the inner plug on the female M22 side is 14mm. The female side has the o-ring to prevent leaking.

It should also be noted that there is also an M22 used on electric pressure washers, but it has a 15mm internal diameter.

3/8″ BSP Thread size

This is a British Standard Pipe thread (BSP) naming convention. It is the imperial name of the fitting size but not the size of the fitting (yes, weird). The actual size of the major diameter of a 3/8″ BSP thread is around 16.66mm (~2/3-inch).

Quick Connect Plug and Socket Sizes

All the quick connects we’ve seen have been 3/8″ QC. You don’t need to get the calipers out for the quick connects.

Now that you know the types and sizes of fittings, adapters and couplings let’s look at examples (with pictures) of them in everyday use.

1.) Quick Connect Fittings to Make Connecting High Pressure Hose to Pump Quick and Easy

In this example you can see how a M22 style hose connection pressure washer hose can be made into a quick connect with a single fitting – a M22 male thread to female 3/8″ quick connect socket. Then you attach a fitting with a male quick connect plug to the pump outlet and you’re set.

2.) Dual M22 Male Coupling to Extend Length of Two High Pressure Hoses

Use this simple coupling to connect two M22 female connection hose ends. It make it so you don’t have to move your pressure washer all the time as you have more leeway with the longer hose.

3.) Make Hose to Spray Gun Quick Connect

This is the same two fittings used in example #1 except at the spray gun end. The 3/8 inch QC couplings allow for much quicker install and exit of the spray wand from the hose when needed.

4.) Multiple Fittings to Insert Pressure Gauge Between Spray Gun and Hose

We test the pressures on the pressure washers so we need a pressure gauge inserted into the assembly. The pressure gauge has quick connect fittings so the proper adapters are required to make the spray gun and hose quick connect.

Some residential electric pressure washers have custom (to that brand) fittings. So if you want to replace the spray gun or hose you’ll often have to replace it with the same brand.

Another thing to be aware of is when they do have M22 screw connection the internal diameter will usually be different than the M22 on gas.

The electric pressure washer coupler will have internal diameter of 15mm instead of 14mm. That means if you try to connect your hose from your gas machine to your electric the hose female fitting will have the 14mm o-ring and the electric spray wand will have 15mm internal diameter. There’s 1mm of space – it will leak. There are two types of fittings that are must owns (in our opinion). The quick connect couplers and gun swivels. Both make pressure washing more enjoyable and easier.

Quick Connect Couplers

Quick connects make it so much easier to attach and detach the hose from the spray gun and the pump. With the screw connection it takes 15 seconds longer and is hard to do with only one hand. All-in-all for only a couple bucks you can make your life easier.

Gun Swivels 

Gun swivel fittings are great. They prevent and unkink the hose, which is amazing. You’ll know what I mean if you’ve ever dealt with 50-feet of hose. Wrangling the hose when pressure washing is avoidable. With a gun swivel.

Advantages of Commercial Pressure Washing

Dingy roofs, dirty siding, parking lots filled with discarded gum, dirt and oil stains – these are just a few of the issues that commercial real estate managers have to face on a daily basis. Commercial power washing is a great solution for many of these issues. Here are 5 advantages of commercial power washing:

Get your roof looking great without a replacement. For sites that have a traditional elevated roof, a commercial power washing treatment can restore the shingles and give them a like new look. Mold and mildew stains can be removed without damaging the materials and restore the roof, saving you the expense of a new roof installation.

Give your customers a positive first experience. Instead of customers having to walk through a dingy parking lot, a professional parking lot restoration can provide a great first impression. Parking lot restoration can remove discarded gum, oil stains and grime.

Thorough restoration of siding. Mold and mildew can grow on your building’s siding, giving it a dull look. With a commercial pressure washing treatment, your siding will look new.

Commercial power washing protects landscaping. Our teams of trained power washing specialists use more than just water to get your commercial site clean. In fact, we use biodegradable cleaners that not only remove grime, but that will not damage your landscaping investment.

Rinsing is critical. Professional commercial power washing teams know that the finish is in the rinse. A three-step rinsing process ensures that the siding, roof or concrete that is being treated has the best final result.

The Art of Pressure Washing

Synopsis: If done correctly, pressure washing can be a godsend when it comes time to paint. It can help remove dirt, mildew, algae, and oxidation — all key contributors of paint failure. This article explains power, spray position, hose attachments, and cleaning-solutions to help you ensure that your siding is properly prepped, not wrecked.

If you read the label on a few different cans of paint, you’ll notice some similarities. One way or another, the instructions will tell you to scrape all loose paint, to repair all damaged areas, and to clean the surface thoroughly. To do the best possible job, I have made pressure washing a regular step for all my finishes.

However, there is an art to pressure washing a house, whether you are doing it to prep for painting or just to clean the siding. It’s like the story of The Three Little Pigs: Too much, and you could blow your house down; too little, and you could huff and puff all day long to no effect.

A pressure washer is not a paint remover

Pressure washers are for washing. They are not for removing paint. If you manage to use a pressure washer as a paint remover, you’re probably washing hard enough to damage the siding, and possibly forcing water inside the walls. The reason to wash the house is to remove dirt, algae, mildew, and oxidation that can cause paint failure. Loose and flaking paint should be scraped and sanded, and damaged siding and trim should be repaired before the house is washed.

Although I tend to wash harder than other contractors, I tailor my technique to each house. On an 80-year-old house, I use less pressure than on a 3-year-old repaint, and I avoid areas that may be prone to leaking. To be sure that water is not getting into walls, I always ask permission to go inside the house, where I check for leakage around doors and windows.

Although a pressure washer is not a paint remover, washing can loosen paint. So when I’m done washing the house, I check for newly loosened or flaking paint before I prime.

Bleach cures the mildew problem

One of the biggest problems with existing paint jobs is mildew. Mildew discolors the paint, causes adhesion problems with new paint, and even can damage the siding. To combat this problem, I apply a 3-to-1 water to bleach solution before I pressure wash. I mix the solution in a garden sprayer and apply it to the entire house. When washing houses, I prefer the garden sprayer to the chemical injector on the pressure washer because the sprayer is easy to move around the house and up and down a ladder.

Be careful with the bleach. I’ve never had a problem, but I have heard of people experiencing adverse skin reactions to the mist. If your skin is sensitive, wear long sleeves, pants, a respirator, and rubber gloves.

Although the sprayer and pressure washer both are accurate applicators, be mindful of overspray and run-off. I generally don’t like to use chemicals on surfaces that are not going to be repainted, but if the house has a deck, I usually wash it anyway. Otherwise, I’m very careful not to let the bleach solution drip on decks or wood-shake roofs because the bleach can leave noticeable clean spots.

Your equipment needs will vary based on your service offering and scope. For example, if you’re just focused on pressure washing for residential clients, then you’ll need a pressure washer with a force of 3,500 PSI and above, hoses, first and second story reach nozzles, and a downstream valve. If you’re going to be doing commercial work, then you’ll need stronger equipment with more functionalities and your own water reservoir.
