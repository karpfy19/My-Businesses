Before we can adequately define “junk removal” we must consider what each word means.

Junk (n.) – (1) any old or discarded material, as metal, paper, or rags, (2) anything that is regarded as worthless, meaningless, or contemptible; trash.

Removal (n.) – (1) the act of removing, (2) change of residence, position, etc. 

Although the junk definition is correct, it’s only partially true. You might have donatable items, still in great condition, which can be recycled reused and otherwise redistributed. (i.e. Goodwill, i guess Habitat ReStore).

Here’s where the removal comes in: We’ll take away ANYTHING non-hazardous from your property (home, office or even a plot of land). Our hunks will go in and provide the labor*, loading and disposal associated with the removal of the items.

Our bright orange trucks are designed to hold your items whether total junk or still usable items (like furniture) and take them to one of our redistribution resources. We reuse, recycle and redistribute over 65% (and sometimes more) of items we get on jobs.

Unfortunately some items end up in the landfill but we are on a constant mission to divert as many materials as possible.

Junk Removal Done Right

There are multitudes of functions that every business must carry out each day. But, unless they're a junk hauling firm, commercial junk removal shouldn't be one of them.

Almost every business generates junk and debris. And, for the most part, the regular office or shop trash disposal services work just fine. But then there are those businesses that produce large amounts of debris on a regular basis such as construction. 

And that's not going to fit into a trash can!

But other businesses periodically find themselves with unwieldy amounts of debris, trash or junk items that need to be disposed of. The challenge for many of these businesses is whether to do it themselves or find an expert firm to do it for them.

Commercial Junk Removal Done Right

While some companies might have the resources for carrying out large junk removal and disposal, most don't. So it is a major chore, a costly interruption in their normal functions, and more than they can manage properly. 

That's why the smart business move in those instances is to hire a firm and will get it done right.

Whether you're a general contractor, an insurance firm, real estate agent or a self-storage facility, there are times when you will need professional help to get rid of that junk.

Five Benefits of Professional Commercial Junk Removal

There are a number of other benefits that come from having a professional firm handle your commercial junk removal needs for your firm. Some are tangible, like the long-term cost savings, and others are intangible, yet equally valuable.

So, even if you are tempted to haul your company’s junk yourself, or for hire someone you know with a truck, there is unmatched value that comes from using professional commercial junk removal:

1. Measurable Cost Savings

When your employees are cleaning and hauling your junk, the opportunity cost of other work not getting done becomes an expensive proposition. Every hour spent cleaning or hauling is an hour not spent on their jobs. And it will take them far longer than a professional firm. 

2. Convenience is a Value Factor

The amount of time involved in clearing out, loading, and then hauling and disposing of your business junk this can add up to a lot of hours. Having someone outside the company simply come in and take care of it delivers a high degree of convenience. 

3. Reliability and Efficiency of Outsourcing

There is huge value in having the peace of mind that your commercial junk hauler is reliable and efficient. And while it may seem to be a simple matter of throwing stuff into the back of a truck, efficiency includes the recycling and re-purposing of your materials that a quality firm will do.

4. Employee Safety

Moving business junk it can be hazardous for your employees. Getting banged up and suffering back strains are very real possibilities. Having your employees handle the junk hauling creates potential for injuries and lost productivity.

5. Aesthetics and Storage Space

Too many businesses simply move their excess equipment and other junk from one space to another, or they end up outside, creating unsightly and potentially hazardous conditions. Having it removed quickly and safely by a professional hauling company improves the aesthetics, safety and appearance of a workplace.

Good News For Commercial Junk Removal

Almost every business has this one thing in common: they all produce junk that has to be hauled away. But there's good news for business owners with junk!

Even if your organization is not a manufacturing enterprise, just being around for a long period of time will result in an accumulation of junk. Whether it's old office furniture and equipment, or just over-sized trash and debris, it all has to be gotten rid of somehow.

If your business model is one that requires you to haul things to the local landfill or recycling center on a regular basis, then you're probably covered in this area. But, far more likely, you don't have employees doing that consistently, if ever. Which means you have to make some kind of arrangements for it when the need for commercial junk removal arises.

Sometimes the Waste Management Service Isn't Enough

If you've tried to hand off an old office desk or unwanted credenza to your regular waste disposal vendor, you've probably experienced the disappointment that comes when you find out they won't take them.

Some waste management companies will allow for a special pick up to be arranged, but often with an additional fee. If that's the case, and it only occurs once or twice a year, that may be sufficient for your needs.

However, if that is not an option or, more likely, you have large commercial junk removal needs far more frequently, you have to find another way.

Essentially, you have two options with your large trash hauling chore: either you do it yourself (i.e. your staff) or you have to pay someone to do it for you. And don't fall into the fiscal mind trap of thinking that "doing it yourself" is going to save you money. Time is money, and it takes time for your employees to stage the debris and junk, load it onto a suitable vehicle, transport it to a suitable facility for disposal, unloading it all, and then returning the truck or simply getting back to your workplace.

And the cost is actually "double" in the sense that any employees thus engaged are not doing the work you are actually paying them to do, so the loss of productivity - that you're still paying for - is costing you money.

An Alternative to "Doing it (All) Yourself"

There is a way to get rid of your own commercial junk and debris without having to do everything.  You can make use of a unique dumpster option: conveniently-sized MINI Dumpster rentals. 

MINI Dumpsters from Junk King are clean and accessible dumpster boxes designed for both ease of use and ease of access. A standard-sized commercial dumpster can hold 40 up to cubic yards of debris. But it also takes up a huge amount of space.  And one of the problems of these ugly beasts is that, for many commercial junk hauling tasks it's more capacity than is needed.

The smaller and more efficient MINI Dumpster holds a hefty 12-cubic yards of material but it only takes up a space of 8 by 12 feet in your parking lot or next to a loading dock. So, not only is it extremely easy to get into and fill, it takes up far less space at your facility.

The MINI Dumpster service offers a convenient online booking system. Just go online or call to book a MINI, and we'll deliver it to your facility and return to pick it up after three days, or even longer, if you need it.

The standard pricing model for most junk hauling companies is to charge a single price, regardless of the volume, and often add in other charges.

We do it differently at Junk King. We offer a three tier rental pricing option for our MINI Dumpster: minimum, half-full and full.  We provide these flexible pricing options in order to give you better value.

If you have only a few items, you'll qualify for the minimum charge typically, which means you only pay our lowest charge to drop off and pick up the MINI Dumpster. If your MINI dumpster is at or about half-full, you'll pay about a 30 percent less than the full price, depending on your location. And, if your MINI is more than half full, you pay the full price for the rental service.

Considering the convenience, the ease of use, and the great pricing, choosing a MINI Dumpster for your business junk and debris clean up project makes great business sense!

Finding a Better Way for Commercial Junk Removal

The business of business junk removal is our business. In other words, hauling and disposing of business junk is not what your company does. But it is what companies like Junk King do. And we are both experts and professionals.
