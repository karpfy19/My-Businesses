Carpet cleaning goes one step further that vacuuming alone to wash your carpet fibers and remove ground-in dirt and stains. Vacuums, even the best ones only get some of the dirt is deep in your carpets. The carpet cleaning process is engineered to reach the dirt vacuums leave behind, with some carpet cleaners leaning carpets up to 10 times cleaner than vacuuming alone*. Although deep cleaning does so much more than vacuuming, the actual effort needed is about as easy as vacuuming. Do it yourself carpet cleaning is an easy and affordable task for households of all budgets and skill levels. Whether you constantly clean up spots & stains or occasionally clean all the carpets in your home, owning a carpet cleaner has definite benefits.

Vacuuming 101

Proper vacuuming is the easiest and most effective way to keep your carpet clean. Regular vacuuming can also have the largest impact on the air you breathe by removing dust, dirt, allergens, and particles.

To get the most out of your vacuuming regime, remember these few easy tips:

A quick once-over doesn’t do much. Slow and steady does the trick.

When vacuuming, don’t ignore those corners and crevices where dust builds.

“Top-down” cleaning saves you the step of vacuuming again after dusting. Dust blinds, windowsills, and furniture surfaces first and then vacuum away any fallen dust.

Remember to replace or empty vacuum bags when they are half to two-thirds full as this improves the efficacy of the vacuum.

How Often Should You Vacuum?

As a rule of thumb, you should vacuum at least once a week with a Seal of Approval-certified vacuum cleaner. However, the more foot traffic over your carpet, the more you need to vacuum.

Cleaning Essentials

Four Steps for Proper Carpet Care

Carpet cleaning is all about developing a routine. If you get into a good routine and keep it up, you will see great results. Products that rate highly on CRI’s Seal of Approval (SOA) program are your assurance that you will clean correctly the first time (more on the SOA program below). Here are four simple steps to keep your carpet clean and looking great:

Vacuum regularly and more frequently in high traffic areas, and everywhere according to a vacuuming schedule, using a Seal of Approval-certified vacuum.

Clean spots and spills quickly with products that do not damage the carpet or cause it to resoil quicker. SOA-certified solutions to clean effectively and maintain the life of carpet.

Professionally deep clean your carpets every 12 to 18 months to remove embedded dirt and grime. SOA-certified cleaners are recommended and sometimes required by the manufacturer.

Stop dirt at the door by using mats outside and in, taking your shoes off when you enter the house and changing your air filters to reduce airborne dust particles.

The Seal of Approval Program

CRI wants vacuums, extractors, cleaning systems, cleaning products, and service providers to be as effective as possible.  The Seal of Approval program is the only one in the industry that scientifically measures cleaning efficacy. The results help consumers make informed decisions and manufacturers improve their products.  So carpets are cleaner, healthier, and last longer.  Find out more about the Seal of Approval Program. 

Basic Rug Care

Rugs deserve the same care as wall-to-wall carpet and, in some cases, require special attention.

Washing rugs — If your rug is small and the label says “machine washable,” shake the rug outside first and then put it in the washing machine at the recommended temperature. Use warm water (90 to 105 degrees) and a mild detergent. Tumble your rug dry on the lowest heat setting.

Beating larger rugs — If your larger rug is easy to pick up, shake it outside first; then put it over a clothesline and beat it. Next, take the rug inside and vacuum it. Many carpet cleaning professionals have rug cleaning expertise as well, but, if the label says dry clean only, your best bet may be to roll it up and take it to a dry cleaner. Save time by calling first to see if the cleaner does rug cleaning — many do not.

Vacuuming area rugs — Area rugs with fringe require special technique. Use gentle suction and start from the center of the carpet, vacuuming toward the fringe, and being careful not to catch the strands in the beater bar. Lift the carpet edge to vacuum beneath the fringe.

Caring for Oriental, Turkish, or Persian rugs — Clean imported rugs according to your carpet manufacturer’s specifications or bring in a professional cleaning service. Be gentle with fringe. For heirloom-type rugs, you need to hire a professional.

Cleaning Spots and Spills

A Two-Step Solution

With today’s stain-resistant carpet, treating spots and stains has never been easier. While no carpet is completely stain proof, the key is to act quickly with the right solution to knock out spots with a one-two punch.

Step One: Absorb the Spill

Blot liquids with a dry, white absorbent cloth or plain white paper towels (no prints or colors). Using a printed or colored material may transfer ink or dye to your damp carpet. Continue until the area is barely damp. Semisolids, like food spills, may need to be scooped up with a spoon. Solid, dried bits can be vacuumed.

Do not scrub or use a brush! Bristles and scrubbing can damage the carpet. Fraying and texture change are the likely results.

Step Two: Treat the Spot or Stain

Use a CRI Certified Seal of Approval Carpet cleaning product. Though these have been laboratory tested, you should still pretest any cleaner on a scrap of carpet or an unseen area of your carpet.

Follow the product’s directions carefully. (Note: more is not better.) Apply a small amount of the cleaner to a white cloth and work in gently, from the edges to the center. Blot; don’t scrub. You may need to do this several times to remove the spot. After the spot is gone, blot the area with clear water once or more to remove any remaining product.

Special Carpet Cleaning Tips for Pet Owners

Do you have a pet? You can combat pet odors and stains in many ways:

Vacuum carpet more frequently to capture pet hair and dander from your pet’s fur.

Use Seal of Approval Cleaning Products that are specifically designed for pet stains and odors.

Clean up new messes promptly and then follow the steps for spot and stain removal.

Use small hand extractors for quick cleanups of pet accidents, but remember that these quick clean ups don’t take the place of periodic deep cleaning.

Have your carpet professionally cleaned every 12 to 18 months More frequently if necessary.

Don’t use a steam cleaner when dealing with urine spots because the heat will set the stain and the smell. Extracting the spill with a wet-vacuum and rinsing with cool water will reduce the odor. If necessary, contact a certified carpet cleaning firm that knows how to remove pet stains and odors permanently.

Do-It-Yourself Extracting

Tips for Cleaning Carpet Yourself

These days, you can buy or rent a do-it-yourself extractor. While these machines are effective at cleaning spots and spills, and provide excellent interim cleaning, they do not take the place of periodic deep cleaning by a carpet cleaning professional.

Here’s what you need to know about do-it-yourself extraction cleaning:

Remove the furniture from the carpeted area. If the furniture is too heavy, place a plastic film under and around the legs of the furniture.

Vacuum thoroughly. This can have the biggest impact on the whole process!

Follow the instructions on the machine carefully. Do not add other chemicals or attempt to make your cleaner stronger.

Only use a Seal of Approval cleaning solution that works with your extractor.

Begin at the farthest point from the doorway and work back toward it so you can step out when done. Do not clean yourself into a corner!

Be patient and do not over-wet the carpet. Extract as much of the water as possible. Do not rush this step.

Wait until the carpet dries before replacing the furniture or walking on carpet. This step can take 6-12 hours.

Ventilate the area. Open windows if outdoor weather conditions permit, or put the air conditioning on a moderate setting (72 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit). Never close up a room with a wet carpet. You want the fastest drying-time possible to prevent mold growth and to allow earlier use.

CHEM-DRY VS. STEAM CLEANING

Carpets serve as natural air filters in your home, trapping dust, allergens, and germs from the air and keeping them from your lungs. Over time, though, those particles can accumulate, and eventually, they can be released back into your home in greater concentrations. Many homeowners may not be aware of the issue and suffer the negative health effects without realizing there are simple solutions available.

Some choose to hire a professional carpet steam cleaner to come to the home and clean the carpets for them. Others will either buy or rent their own steam carpet cleaner and struggle with the machine before finally throwing up their hands and calling a professional anyway. It’s certainly possible to steam clean carpet yourself, but it carries the same problems as hiring a professional carpet steam cleaner with the added hassle of wrestling with an unwieldy piece of equipment. There is a better professional solution available.

Not all carpet cleaning services are equal

When searching for a quality carpet cleaner, keep in mind that not all carpet cleaning services are created equal. There are several key factors that separate a high quality carpet cleaning process that delivers a healthier cleaning for your carpets and home from one that drenches your carpets with gallons of water and harsh cleaners. These factors explain why our unique Hot Carbonating Extraction system at Chem-Dry offers a deeper, faster drying, healthier carpet cleaning experience than typical steam cleaning services.

When you steam clean carpet, you saturate it with an excessive amount of water filled with soaps and detergents. This results in carpets that remain wet for 1-2 days, which creates a breeding ground for mold, mildew and bacteria. Plus, the soapy residue left behind by carpet steam cleaners attracts dirt and causes your carpets to get dirty much faster.

At Chem-Dry our process is different. Instead of soaking your carpets with water like a carpet steam cleaner, our process employs millions of microscopic bubbles to explode dirt from deep in your carpet fibers, so therefore we only need to use a fraction of the water that a typical steam carpet cleaner uses—almost 80% less in fact. We also use a natural carpet cleaner instead of a cleaner with heavy soaps and detergents. After the carbonation releases and lifts the dirt, our high-powered equipment extracts the dirt and moisture from the carpet. While the drying time relies on several factors, such as humidity, airflow, and the carpet itself, the carpet will typically be dry within just an hour or two and ready for you to enjoy.

So, while carpet steam cleaners use excessive amounts of water that often soaks through to the carpet backing and creates a breeding ground for mold and mildew, our low-moisture process doesn't carry the same risk and offers a safer and more convenient carpet cleaning solution. Plus, your carpets dry in just a few hours, not 1-2 days like with typical steam carpet cleaning, and your carpet stays cleaner longer because there is no soapy residue left behind. With Chem-Dry, carpet cleaning doesn’t need to be a hassle.

Carpet Cleaning Methods: Pros and Cons

Not sure which carpet cleaning method would be best for your home's carpets? Weigh the pros and cons for each.

Professional carpet cleaning companies use several carpet cleaning methods to clean a home’s carpets. Each cleaning method has its own particular advantages and disadvantages. But how do you choose between them? Review these pros and cons before deciding which method you would like to be used to clean your carpet.

Basically, carpet cleaning methods may be placed in one of two categories: wet cleaning or dry cleaning. Wet cleaning includes hot water extraction and can include cleaning with an absorbent pad. Dry carpet cleaning involves the use of chemical powders or foams applied by special machines with counter rotating brushes, pads or cylinders.

1. Wet cleaning

How it works

Also known as hot water extraction or steam cleaning, the carpet is first pre-conditioned with a chemical reagent that liquefies soils and oil-based substances which may be present in the carpet fibers. Water is heated to a temperature near its boiling point and pressurized, then injected into the carpet. After about 10 to 15 minutes, the solution is extracted with a vacuum.

Pros

Gets out soiling from deep down in the carpet.

Allows the use of high temperatures, pressures and chemical concentrates.

Permits extended dwell times for reaction of cleaning solvents.

Chemical reactivity facilitated by agitation with grooming tool or extraction wand.

Most widely used method.

Recommended by carpet manufacturers and industry cleaning experts and professionals

Cons

Relatively long drying time, but this can be reduced with the use of powerful equipment by competent technicians.

Expensive equipment usually required for maximum efficiency.

Relatively high cost factors.

2. Cleaning with an absorbent pad

How it works

This carpet cleaning method is also commonly known as bonnet cleaning and is most often used for routine light maintenance. It can also be used for regular carpet cleaning. The carpet is first vacuumed, and then a chemical solution is sprayed on to it with a hand pump or electric sprayer. The solution is allowed to stay on the carpet for a suitable dwell or reaction time.

The absorbent pad or bonnet, which looks like a towel, is placed on the drive block of a rotary floor machine and spun over the carpet surface at 100 to 300 rpm. This action serves to impregnate the carpet fibers with the chemical solution and then pick it up with the soils afterward.

Pros

Fast, simple and inexpensive.

Excellent results with lightly soiled carpets.

Cons

Only cleans the top one-third of carpet fibers, incapable of reaching deeper down.

Leaves dirt and chemicals to accumulate at the bottom of the carpet fibers.

3. Dry cleaning with an absorbent compound

How it works

A powder that has been mixed with special solvents and cleaning agents is spread over the carpet, and then worked into the carpet fibers with a machine fitted with counter-rotating brushes. The powder absorbs soils in the carpet fibers. After it’s allowed to set on the carpet for 10 to 15 minutes, it’s vacuumed up.

Pros

Very simple system with no special technical training required.

Very fast drying, it typically only takes about 20 minutes before the carpet can be back in service.

Cons

Powder may be trapped in plush pile carpets and left to build up over time.

Can cause excessive dust build-up in the home.

Unable to clean deep down into the carpet.

4. Dry foam or rotary shampoo method

How it works

A cleaning agent is applied to the carpet to help suspend dirt and debris in the carpet, which is then whipped into foam and worked into the carpet fibers with the rotating brushes of a special machine. After a short dwell time, the foam is extracted with a vacuum.

Pros

Fast, simple to apply and inexpensive.

Rotating brushes provide excellent agitation.

Small amount of moisture allows fast drying of carpet.

Cons

Unable to achieve thorough soil extraction below the surface of the carpet.

High temperatures usually not achieved.

Excessive wetting possible with equipment malfunction.
