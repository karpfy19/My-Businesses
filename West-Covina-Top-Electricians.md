What is an Electrician?

Electricians are responsible for inspecting, testing, repairing, installing, and modifying electrical components and systems. Electricians general work at homes, businesses, and construction sites, and generally work as contractors.

The United States does not offer nationwide licensing and electrical licenses are issued by individual states. There are variations in licensing requirements, however, all states recognize three basic skill categories: level electricians. Journeyman electricians can work unsupervised provided that they work according to a master's direction. Generally, states do not offer journeyman permits, and journeyman electricians and other apprentices can only work under permits issued to a master electrician. Apprentices may not work without direct supervision. Before electricians can work unsupervised, they are usually required to serve an apprenticeship lasting from 3 to 5 years under the general supervision of a Master Electrician and usually the direct supervision of a Journeyman Electrician.[10] Schooling in electrical theory and electrical building codes is required to complete the apprenticeship program. Many apprenticeship programs provide a salary to the apprentice during training. A Journeyman electrician is a classification of licensing granted to those who have met the experience requirements for on the job training (usually 4000 to 6000 hours) and classroom hours (about 144 hours). Requirements include completion of two to six years of apprenticeship training, and passing a licensing exam.[11]

5 Signs you May or May not Need an Electrician

If you are wondering whether or not you should hire an electrician this New Year’s, you probably should. While paying an electrician to do minor repairs for your home can seem costly, you may be saving money, time, and peace of mind in the long run. When you leave common electrical problems unchecked, you pose a risk of a potentially dangerous outcome.

Flickering Lights

Notice the lights in your home or office flicker or blink? Flickering lights or blinking lights that change in brightness and dimness can signal several issues. Some of which require an electrician and some of which do not. If you see a lightbulb that begins to flicker or blink, turn off the light and unplug the device. Ensure that you are using the correct bulb type and that the bulb is installed correctly and tightly. The issue just might be your light bulb.

Another factor could be a loose light plug, an issue with the switch, or even a more significant issue such as sensory overload or loose wirings. Additionally, there could also be a problem with your meter box if you notice multiple bulbs having the same issue. In this case, hiring an electrician such as Asbury Electric would be your best bet with flickering lights.

Trip in Circuit Breaker

If you notice your circuit breaker tripped, worry not. Most likely, you can reset the switch, and you’re good to go. Right? If you find your circuit breaker continually tripping, you will have to identify where the root of the problem is located in your home or office. It is best to ensure all light switches and appliances are off. You will want to reset all areas of the house from on to off and then back to on. If your circuit breaker continues to trip after doing a full reset, you will want to call an electrician immediately to inspect the issue further.

Overloaded or Warm Electrical Outlets

Although we may hardly give any of our attention to the outlets in our home, you may stumble upon a warm or hot outlet when either plugging something in or removing a plug. Why or how did your electrical outlet get so heated? To begin with, warm or hot electrical outlets are not healthy. If you do not want to call an electrician, you will want to reset your circuit breaker and unplug everything from the hot outlet. Your outlet may be warm because of an overloaded circuit, which means you are plugging in more than what your circuit can handle. If you are still unable to resolve your warm electrical outlet, you will want to call an electrician. This may be a more severe case, such as a bad connection, which poses the risk of even a fire.

Fuse Blowout

Whether you have a new or old home, there should be some circuit breaker or fuse box that is designed for circuit overloads or when your circuit trips. However, when a fuse blows, you will need replacing. Fuses can blow when there is an overload or if there is a hot wire that makes contact with the grounding pathway or a neutral wire. Additionally, it may take a while understanding where or what is caused your fuse to blow. If you are not a trained professional electrician, you will want to hire one such as Asbury Electric to diagnose the issue thoroughly.

Changes in your Electric Bill

Notice significant changes in your electric bill? If your electric bill is too high, you’ll want to find out what the cause is and how you can lower it for months to come. Whether your recent bill is higher than usual or you notice a consistent increase each month, you’ll want to take these steps to ensure you find the source and resolve the issue immediately. The most obvious answer may be what electronics are using the most in your home, and if you have recently invested in an electronic device or appliance that may be eating up your bill. This could mean how long you have the TV on, leaving the refrigerator door open, how many loads of laundry you have done, and how often you run the dishwasher. Another factor maybe if you are using old electrical appliances in your home. Lastly, which electronic devices have been left on without you being aware of it? This can range from smart home automation platforms to your computer being left on standby.

Hiring An Electrician

Electricity is by far one of the greatest inventions ever to have come along. However, electricity can be very dangerous. Each year, many homeowners suffer serious injury or even death by attempting to repair electrical equipment or problems themselves. For this reason, it is usually best to hire a professionally trained electrician.

Fortunately, electrical problems are not commonplace. However, they do occur, and knowing that someone can be called who can truly and safely fix the problem can be a tremendous relief to the homeowner.

When looking for a electrician, the homeowner will, of course, want to ascertain that the electrician possesses all licenses, permits, and certificates, and carries insurance. All should be current and valid. In this way, if by some remote possibility, there is damage, or the electrician is injured while performing the work, the homeowner will know that everything will be taken care of.

The homeowner should be able to describe the problem as accurately as possible when calling electricians and comparing rates. In this way, the electrician will be able to give a more accurate estimate of how much the repairs will be, and the homeowner will be able to make a more informed decision.

The electrician should be willing to tell the customer as best as possible what the job will entail, and how much time it should take. If the electrician is reluctant to do this, the homeowner should look for one that will.

The homeowner should not hesitate to ask the electrician about his or her experience. The reputable, competent electrician will not mind giving this information, and indeed may volunteer to tell the homeowner this before the homeowner even asks.

Many electricians will supply references, either voluntarily or on request. The homeowner can then speak with someone who has actually used this person, and can determine if he or she is the right one for the job.

Five Top Tips For Saving Money When Hiring Electricians

1. Compare the rates of electricians online. Online marketplaces where you can find electricians in your local area (or professionals who will travel out to you) have become increasingly popular in recent years - and for good reason. Here, you are in control as a buyer, and you can pick and choose between the array of electricians available.

2. If the electrician you choose is working towards an hourly rate, make sure you try and select someone who specializes in the job that you need doing: if they have experience of doing the type of task you require, it will undoubtedly take them less time.

3. Remember: authorized electricians are important to ensure work is carried out on your home's electrics safely - and you may not be permitted to conduct some electrical work on your own property. The main reason for this is because if something goes wrong with the work you have carried out - in the form of a power cut or even a fire - insurance companies might not cover you on the basis that you did this without seeking professional help, which would have saved you money anyway.

4. When electricians are giving you a quote, make sure you are getting a breakdown of the costs, including the expense of labor and the parts needed to complete the job. One of the most unhelpful things for any electrician to do can be to give you an invoice that is generic and doesn't include an itemized quote for you to review. If one electrician can provide you with the parts needed for your job for less money, and the other is willing to work for a cheaper hourly rate, why don't you split the job to minimize the cost?

5. Don't be afraid to negotiate. Haggling is an art that not many of us are confident with. By just trying to reduce the quote that they give you ever so slightly, you could reduce the financial burden of hiring an electrician substantially. For many electricians, they will have an attitude that dropping a small amount of money off the price of their labor will be worthwhile considering the work and the income that you would be providing.

Ultimately, by doing your research and by understanding the exact things that you need an electrician to do, you will be able to get accurate quotes from a variety of experts. Making sure that you know your requirements in depth is the most important thing of all, especially if you want to ensure that the electrician you hire doesn't need to exceed the budget you have allocated.
