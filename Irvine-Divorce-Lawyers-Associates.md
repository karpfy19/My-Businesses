Divorce Lawyer

A divorce is the legal termination of a marriage by a court in a legal proceeding, requiring a petition or complaint for divorce (or dissolution in some states) by one party. There are two types of divorce-- fault and no-fault. A fault divorce is a judicial termination of a marriage based on marital misconduct or other statutory cause requiring proof in a court of law by the divorcing party that the divorcee had done one of several enumerated things as sufficient grounds for the divorce. All states now have adopted some form of no-fault divorce; although some such as New York, restrict the availability of no-fault divorce and retain fault divorce generally. A no-fault divorce is one in which neither party is required to prove fault, and one party must allege and testify only that either irretrievable breakdown of the marriage or irreconcilable differences between the parties makes termination of the marriage appropriate. Many states continue to offer a separation agreement or decree, under which the right to cohabitation is terminated but the marriage is not dissolved and the marital status of the parties is unaltered.

State law governs divorces, so the petitioning or complaining party can only file in the state in which he/she is and has been a resident for a certain period of time, which varies by state. The most common issues in divorces are division of property, child custody and support, alimony (spousal support), child visitation and attorney's fees. Only state courts have jurisdiction over divorces, so the petitioning or complaining party can only file in the state in which he/she is and has been a resident for a period of time. In most states, the legal process of the divorce procedures take some time, to allow for a chance of reconciliation. The divorce decree is a court order that states the rights and responsibilities of the divorced parties, including the basic information regarding the divorce, case number, parties, date of divorce, and terms the parties have agreed upon.

Sexual relations with anyone other than your spouse is still a crime in many states, even if the married couple is seeking a divorce. The judge has a great deal of discretion in custody cases and in awarding or restricting visitation rights. Extramarital sexual relations before divorce may be used as evidence of marital misconduct during the marriage.

Also, cohabitation with another person may be a factor in reducing support payments received.
 
Divorce in the United States is in accordance with state law rather than governed extensively by federal regulations. A divorce lawyer specializes in civil law. This field can be saturated with emotions and life-changing decisions. Therefore, a divorce lawyer must delicately yet justly handle a wide variety of family law issues from divorce, marriage annulment, and legal separation to child custody, child support and visitation rights. They are also called divorce attorneys or family practice lawyers.

A divorce can take three to twelve months to finalize. However, it depends on how the divorce is filed. It may be a fault or no-fault divorce, contested or uncontested divorce or simplified divorce. The many legal issues to settle and the amount of conflict to mediate influence the time frame.

Job Description & Skills Required

When terminating a marriage, many legal aspects must be addressed. A divorce lawyer is responsible for the division of assets and debt among spouses. If there are children involved, a divorce lawyer helps set the terms for child custody and child support. Thorough research is required in order to gather supporting evidence in each case. Detailed paperwork must be compiled and then submitted to the court documenting the evidence.  For legal separations, a divorce lawyer carries out the separation through court orders.

A divorce lawyer must excel in a few unique skills. They have to be an attentive listener because the decisions made in or out of court will greatly affect their client’s lives.  Although it may be difficult, it is vital a divorce lawyer remains non-judgmental to assist them in promoting their own client’s best interests. Their interpersonal skills must be strong because they are dealing with a variety of relationships in their profession. Advocacy, mediation and alternative dispute resolution skills should be acquired and mastered in law school as well as through continual work experience in the field.
 
Ways Divorce Lawyers help their client
 
Divorce is often an emotionally and financially draining time. However, a qualified divorce attorney can help make the process easier. Here are some of the pivotal roles and tasks that divorce lawyers help their clients with.

Explaining Grounds for Divorce

Every state has established certain grounds for divorce that give one of the spouses the right to petition the court for the dissolution of the marital relationship. Some grounds for divorce are fault-based, such as adultery, cruel treatment, abuse or incarceration.

All states recognize no-fault grounds for divorce. However, some states require that the spouses live separately for a certain period of time before their courts are permitted to dissolve the marital relationship.

A divorce lawyer can explain whether there are any benefits to asking the court to dissolve the marriage based on fault grounds. For example, this may be relevant in determining whether spousal support will be available or how much support will be awarded.

In some cases, there has been a defect in the marriage. A legal requirement may have been ignored, the proper paperwork may not have been filed or a proper ceremony may not have been performed to make the marriage legal. A lawyer can discuss whether voiding or annulling the marriage is preferable to getting a divorce.


Providing Objective Advice

While divorce is an emotional process, a divorce lawyer can help make it less so. He or she can talk to you about factors that will affect your future, such as support and custody issues so that you are less focused on the demise of your marriage.

Additionally, a divorce lawyer can serve as the go-between for you and your spouse. You can avoid personal contact to help make the process easier to get through.

Accounting for Marital Assets

In order to properly distribute the marital estate, a divorce lawyer ensures that his or her client discloses al such assets. In many marriages, one spouse may have handled the money and the other spouse may not be aware of the couple’s debts and assets. A divorce lawyer can help collect records and locate assets and liabilities so that the divorce settlement properly addresses these possessions.

Explain Property Division

A divorce lawyer can explain how property is treated upon the dissolution of the marriage. Each spouse may have separate property that they brought into the marriage. Other spouses may have accumulated assets separately per a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement.

A divorce lawyer can explain whether the state is a community property state or equitable distribution state. This characteristic can make a dramatic difference on the distribution of the marital estate.

Devising a Debt Repayment Plan

Many times, handling the family debt is more tumultuous than splitting assets. Both partners may be legally responsible for joint debt. However, there are many cases in which only one spouse is held financially responsible for the debt. A lawyer can help determine how a spouse can protect himself or herself from debt that should be attributed to the other spouse.

Determining Spousal Support and Other Benefits

A divorce lawyer can help assess whether a spouse may be entitled to spousal support or may be required to pay it. Spousal support may be ordered when spouses have very different incomes or when one spouse sacrificed his or her career to advance the other spouse’s.

Additionally, a spouse may be entitled to a portion of the business interest that the other spouse runs.

Some spouses are only worried about the immediate financial consequences of divorce. However, spouses may be entitled to a portion of their spouse’s pension or Social Security income if they have been married ten years or more.

Helping with Custody Plans

A divorce lawyer can assist clients with developing a parenting plan that works for the parents and addresses the child’s needs.

Preparation with Divorce Papers

In order to get divorced, formal papers must be submitted to the proper court for approval. A divorce lawyer can assist clients with preparing these papers or responding to the other spouse’s petition for divorce.

Negotiating a Settlement

A family law lawyer can help a client negotiate a divorce settlement regarding the marital estate. If this process does not involve litigation, it is typically cheaper and faster than it is when battling it out in court.

Representing in Court

A divorce lawyer can help you litigate your case if you need to. This process may be necessary to resolve disputes regarding child custody, spousal support or divorce.
 
Divorce Law includes the following topics and legal areas:

- Child Support: A determination of the monetary obligation parents have for their minor children. This also addresses medical and/or health insurance coverage, school expenses and the like.

- Child Custody and Visitation: Operating in the best interests of the child, it must be decided whether a child of divorce will reside full-time or part-time with each parent, visitation schedules, holiday schedules, parenting time, etc.

- Spousal Support/Alimony/Maintenance: Often one spouse will be required to provide monetary support to the other spouse for a finite period of time. Many factors are involved in determining the type of support that should be awarded, as well as the amount and the length of time it should be paid.

- Division of Property and Debt: Whether a state is a "community-property state" or an "equitable distribution state" is a large factor in determining what is marital property and what is separate property, and how property and debts will be distributed in a divorce proceeding. Other factors, such as spousal support and child support often come into play as well.

- Separation: State law varies on the recognition of legal separations, and how the topics above will be handled when a couple separates and/or when a divorce/dissolution is pending.
 
 How Do Lawyers Charge for their work? 
 
When a person needs to hire an attorney, one of the first questions he or she asks is how much it will cost. Different attorneys charge different ways for their work. Here is an overview of some of the possibilities.

Hourly

Many lawyers charge only by the hour. Associates often yield a lower hourly rate than partners. However, associates may have to take more time to research a legal issue than a partner who has prior experience on which to rely.

Arrangements that involve hourly rates usually include a retainer that represents an upfront deposit on legal services. After the retainer is exhausted, the client may be billed on a monthly basis for legal fees.

The benefit of this type of arrangement is that the amount that the client is billed reflects the real amount of time that the attorney put into the case. If the work does not require much time, the client will not have a large bill. However, if the legal matter is more complicated than the client originally thought it was, he or she may be in for a surprise when he or she receives the bill.

There is a disadvantage with the hourly rate though. The disadvantage to hourly rates is that hourly rates often cause clients anxiety because they do not provide a clear estimate of how much a particular client will have to pay when the job is finished. Also, hourly rates can encourage inefficiency as attorneys are paid more for taking more time on the matter.

Hourly rates can have disadvantages for lawyers, too. They may wind up pursuing a line of research that does not bring about results. Lawyers may work too many hours in order to make a better living. Lawyers may have greater difficulty with the case because hourly rates may cause clients not to communicate with them because they know they are being charged for such communication.


Flat Fees

Another common payment arrangement for lawyers is to charge flat fees. This type of arrangement is more common in cases and types of law that are well-defined in which the lawyer can predict with reasonable certainty how much time a case will take.

The advantage of this payment arrangement is that it removes uncertainty for clients and lawyers alike. Additionally, clients are not afraid to make contact with their lawyers because they are not charged extra for such communications. Flat fees encourage lawyers to work more efficiently because their pay is not increased by taking more time.

However, the drawback to hourly fees is that they can be bad for lawyers if a case becomes more complicated than they originally anticipated. Lawyers can wind up investing a substantial amount of time for which they are not paid any more money. Lawyers and clients may agree to make adjustments under certain conditions to keep the arrangement fair for both sides of the representation.

Contingency Fees

Another common payment arrangement takes the form of a contingency fee. This arrangement involves the attorney receiving a percentage of the client’s verdict or settlement. If the client loses the case, he or she does not owe the lawyer anything.

This type of payment arrangement is more common with personal injury law and medical malpractice cases. Clients have the advantage of getting legal representation without having to pay upfront for it. This shifts the risk from clients to lawyers because the lawyer is doing all of the work with no guarantee of payment.

The disadvantage to contingency fees is that they can cause clients and attorneys to head toward different goals. For example, a client may want to move toward a trial in hope of getting a big payout, while a lawyer may want to settle the case and get his or her share.

Contingency fees also bring about a certain degree of uncertainty. If the client does receive a settlement or verdict, his or her share may be lower than that of the lawyer because the client must usually reimburse the lawyer for litigation expenses, as well as any medical expenses that the client incurred.

Hybrid Arrangements

Many lawyers have taken stock of their clients’ needs and attempt to cater to them. Hybrid arrangements may include using an hourly rate but applying a minimum and maximum amount for legal representation.

Considerations

A number of factors can affect the amount that a lawyer charges for a particular case. For example, the novelty of the legal issues involved, whether the case would prevent the lawyer from taking on other matters, the experience of the lawyer, the amount of research that is anticipated and the geographic region can all affect the cost of legal services.

Sometimes, lawyers are prohibited from charging over a certain amount based on statutes. For example, contingency fees may be limited to a third of the verdict or Social Security claims may be limited to a certain percentage of the backpay.
