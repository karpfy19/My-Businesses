PLUMBING
 
When talking about plumbing, you will most likely think of the system of pipes in a home or building that will deliver water for various uses such as drinking, washing and even heating. But what is the technical definition of it? Plumbing is not only the system of pipes. It also includes drains fittings, valve and its assemblies and the devices installed together with them and this system is used for the distribution of water for various uses mainly for drinking, washing and heating as well as the removal of waterborne wastes. As a skill, plumbing is a trade working and dealing with the tubing, pipes and various plumbing fixtures.

The skilled or expert in the field of plumbing is called a plumber. This individual install or repairs the systems of the piping, plumbing fixtures and related equipment such as the backflow preventers toilets and hot water systems. With this simple explanation, you can say that plumbing typically deals with the installation and laying of pipe lines that will provide the mean of fluid transportation. The industry of the plumbing is, in a sense, a very substantial part of an economy due to the necessity of clean water and the need for waste transportation and sanitary collection.

Materials

Water systems of ancient times relied on gravity for the supply of water, using pipes or channels usually made of clay, lead, bamboo, wood, or stone. Hollowed wooden logs wrapped in steel banding were used for plumbing pipes, particularly water mains. Logs were used for water distribution in England close to 500 years ago. US cities began using hollowed logs in the late 1700s through the 1800s. Today, most plumbing supply pipe is made out of steel, copper, and plastic; most waste (also known as "soil")[27] out of steel, copper, plastic, and cast iron.[27]

The straight sections of plumbing systems are called "pipes" or "tubes". A pipe is typically formed via casting or welding, whereas a tube is made through extrusion. Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as brazing, compression fitting, crimping, or for plastics, solvent welding.
 
Steel

Galvanized steel potable water supply and distribution pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader. It remains in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.

Most typical single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to expense as well as steel piping's tendency to become obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.

Copper

Copper pipe and tubing was widely used for domestic water systems in the latter half of the twentieth century. Demand for copper products has fallen due to the dramatic increase in the price of copper, resulting in increased demand for alternative products including PEX and stainless steel.

Plastic 

Plastic hot and cold supply piping for a sink

Plastic pipe is in wide use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a variety of materials and fittings employed.

PVC/CPVC – rigid plastic pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls to deal with municipal water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, and it has become a common replacement for metal piping. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and solvent cements as required by code.[28]

PP – The material is used primarily in housewares, food packaging, and clinical equipment,[29] but since the early 1970s has seen increasing use worldwide for both domestic hot and cold water. PP pipes are heat fused, being unsuitable for the use of glues, solvents, or mechanical fittings. PP pipe is often used in green building projects.[30]

PBT – flexible (usually gray or black) plastic pipe which is attached to barbed fittings and secured in place with a copper crimp ring. The primary manufacturer of PBT tubing and fittings was driven into bankruptcy by a class-action lawsuit over failures of this system.[citation needed] However, PB and PBT tubing has since returned to the market and codes, typically first for "exposed locations" such as risers.

PEX – cross-linked polyethylene system with mechanically joined fittings employing barbs, and crimped steel or copper rings.

Polytanks – plastic polyethylene cisterns, underground water tanks, above ground water tanks, are usually made of linear polyethylene suitable as a potable water storage tank, provided in white, black or green.

Aqua – known as PEX-Al-PEX, for its PEX/aluminum sandwich, consisting of aluminum pipe sandwiched between layers of PEX, and connected with modified brass compression fittings. In 2005, many of these fittings were recalled.[further explanation needed]

Present-day water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes in buildings are now made of copper,[31] brass, plastic (particularly cross-linked polyethylene called PEX, which is estimated to be used in 60% of single-family homes[32]), or other nontoxic material. Due to its toxicity, most cities moved away from lead water-supply piping by the 1920s in the United States,[33] although lead pipes were approved by national plumbing codes into the 1980s,[34] and lead was used in plumbing solder for drinking water until it was banned in 1986.[33] Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast iron, or lead.
 
Top 10 Reasons Why Plumbing is so Important

1.   Plumbing harnesses a precious resource —water —to use safely for health, hygiene and well-being. Plumbing makes possible the miracle of clean, convenient water —something often taken for granted.
 
2.   Plumbing manufacturing innovations to gain water efficiency have dramatically reduced the amount of water used through toilets, showerheads, faucets and other plumbing products. For example, WaterSense plumbing products meeting Environmental Protection Agency criteria have saved consumers 757 billion gallons of water and $14.2 billion in water and energy bills since 2006, according to the EPA.
 
3.   To assure customer satisfaction, WaterSense products are certified to perform as well or better than standard models —all while saving at least 20 percent more water.
 
4.   The increased use of water-efficient plumbing is an important, yet often overlooked, part of the water sustainability solution. The EPA estimates that the United States could save 3 trillion gallons of water and over $17 billion dollars annually if every U.S. household converted to WaterSense products. High-efficiency plumbing in commercial facilities can help save even more.
 
5.    Modern plumbing products help regions affected by droughts and water shortages to use water more efficiently. For example, Denver reduced water use to a 40-year low in December 2014, according to the Denver Post. Contributing to the decrease was replacing 3,200 3.5 gallons per flush (gpf) toilets in the Denver Public Schools with 1.25 gpf toilets. Denver has plans to replace 6,800 more by 2018.
 
6.   Water efficiency contributes greatly to energy savings. Less water used means less water heated and less water transported. Installing WaterSense-labeled faucet aerators in bathrooms, for example, help save water and energy.
 
7.    Plumbing brings comfort and beauty into homes and lives. Kitchens and bathrooms not only serve functional purposes; they provide the refuge of comforting meals, soothing baths and restorative relaxation.
 
8.    The plumbing industry is a strong economic engine, providing jobs and livelihoods to millions of people around the world.
 
9.    The ability of plumbing and sanitation systems to deliver clean water and remove waste has protected populations from communicable disease throughout history. There is acknowledgement from many within the public health community that clean, drinkable water has likely protected more lives and extended life expectancy more than any medical advancement. Plumbing advancements continue to protect lives in developing nations.
 
10.   A future of water sustainability is an achievable prospect, as plumbing manufacturers work with allies in safe plumbing and water efficiency to find solutions. 

Several different systems make up a house’s plumbing. Fresh water is delivered to a home through water supply pipes from the utility or a well and is then distributed to sinks, toilets, washers, bathtubs, and related fixtures. The drain-waste-vent system carries away used water and wastes to sewers or septic tanks. Natural-gas plumbing delivers this fuel to gas-burning cooktops, furnaces, water heaters, and clothes dryers. 
 
An expert overview of home plumbing systems, including water supply, drain-waste-vent, and more.

If you have ever camped in the great outdoors, you have probably been reawakened to the joys of modern plumbing. By going without running water, a hot shower, or a flushing toilet, you can fully appreciate how important these are to daily life.

A home’s plumbing system is a complex network of water supply pipes, drainpipes, vent pipes, and more. Because plumbing is complicated and one of the costliest systems to repair or install in a home, it pays to understand how the system works. 

 
Water Supply System

A home’s water supply system routes municipal water from the street to your house, where it branches out to deliver the water to faucets, showers, toilets, bathtubs, and appliances such as the water heater, dishwasher, and washing machine.

The equipment for this delivery and distribution is essentially a system of water pipes, fittings, service valves, and faucets. These pipes and other fittings are commonly made of plastic, copper, or galvanized iron. The pipes range in diameter from 1/2 inch to 4 inches or more. 
 
Drain-Waste-Vent System

Though it isn’t one of the most glamorous parts of a house, the drain-waste-vent (DWV) system is one of the most crucial. The job of the drain-waste part of the system is to carry waste water and sewage from sinks, bathtubs, showers, toilets, and water-using appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines and deliver those wastes to the septic tank or public sewer.

The vent system—part of the plumbing that is usually less well known to most homeowners—is connected to the drain-waste piping, and its job is to ventilate sewage gases so they don’t build up in the house. The vent system also helps drainpipes maintain the right pressure for proper drainage.

The pipes of the DWV system are usually out of sight, hidden in the walls, beneath the floors, and in the attic. But when the system ceases to do its job properly, it is hardly out of mind. Clogged drains are among the most common problems that occur in a DWV system.

Kitchen Plumbing System

If you’re reading this section, the chances are pretty good that either 1) you’re having problems with the pipes or drains in your kitchen or 2) you’re considering (or are in the midst of) a kitchen remodeling project that involves dealing with the pipes in the floor and walls. You’ll find help with both of these kinds of issues here, where we look at planning, installing, and caring for plumbing with a focus on the kitchen.

Most kitchens have a fairly simple plumbing setup that includes hot and cold water supply lines to the faucets; a waste line for the sink (or sinks); and, for kitchens with a gas range, a gas supply pipe. Many kitchens also have hookups for a dishwasher, disposer, ice maker, and/or instant hot water, but these are generally tied in to the sink’s plumbing.

Bathroom Plumbing System

Sinks, showers, bathtubs, and toilets—bathrooms are all about plumbing. The plumbing in a bathroom must handle water delivery to and waste removal from all of these fixtures in an organized, efficient, leak-free manner.

Two plumbing systems are needed to handle a bathroom’s plumbing needs: water supply and drain-waste-vent. The municipal supply or other fresh water source, goes through the meter, and is delivered to the house. At the water heater, it splits into two lines—one that carries cold water and the other that delivers hot water from the water heater to the fixtures that require it.

The drain-waste-vent system collects waste water from fixtures and waste from toilets and delivers them to the sewer or septic system. Near each of the sinks, tubs, showers, and toilets, vent pipes exhaust sewer gases up and out the roof and provide air pressure so wastes can flow freely.

Regarding planning for major plumbing work: A properly designed system will deliver water to the various faucets, fixtures, and water-using appliances efficiently and carry away waste water without clogs. Second, it may save you money. By planning wisely, you can often reduce the overall plumbing expense significantly by locating bathrooms, kitchens, or laundry rooms near one another so that they can share parts of the system.
