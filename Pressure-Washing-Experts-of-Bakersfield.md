A pressure washer or power washer is a high-pressure mechanical sprayer used to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles and concrete surfaces. The volume of a pressure washer is expressed in gallons or liters per minute, often designed into the pump and not variable. The pressure, expressed in pounds per square inch, pascals, or bar (deprecated but in common usage), is designed into the pump but can be varied by adjusting the unloader valve. Machines that produce pressures from 750 to 30,000 psi (5 to 200 MPa) or more are available.

It is important that the water supply be adequate for the pressure washer connected to it, as water starvation will lead to cavitation and damage of the pump elements. Be sure your water source can provide the gallons per minute the pump requires.

The basic pressure washer consists of a motor (either electric, internal combustion, pneumatic or hydraulic) that drives a high-pressure water pump, a high-pressure hose and a trigger gun-style switch. Just as a garden hose nozzle is used to increase the velocity of water, a pressure washer nozzle creates high pressure and velocity.

Different types of nozzle are available for different application. Some nozzles create a water jet that is in a triangular plane (fan pattern), others emit a thin jet of water that spirals around rapidly (cone pattern). Nozzles that deliver a higher flow rate lower the output pressure. Most nozzles attach directly to the trigger gun.

Some washers, with an appropriate nozzle, allow detergent to be introduced into the water stream, assisting in the cleaning process. Two types of chemical injectors are available — a high-pressure injector that introduces the chemical after the water leaves the pump (a downstream injector) and a low-pressure injector that introduces the chemical before water enters the pump (an upstream injector). The type of injector used is related to the type of detergent used, as there are many chemicals that will damage a pump if an upstream injector is used.

Washers are dangerous tools and should be operated with due regard to safety instructions. The water pressure near the nozzle is powerful enough to strip flesh from bone. Particles in the water supply are ejected from the nozzle at great velocities. The cleaning process can propel objects dislodged from the surface being cleaned, also at great velocities. Pressure washers have a tendency to break up tarmac if aimed directly at it, due to high-pressure water entering cracks and voids in the surface.

Most consumer washers are electric or gasoline-powered. Electric washers plug into a normal outlet, are supplied with tap water, and typically deliver pressure up to about 2,000 psi (140 bar). Gas powered washers can deliver twice that pressure, but due to the hazardous nature of the engine exhaust, they are unsuitable for enclosed or indoor areas. Some models can generate hot water, which is ideal for loosening and removing oil and grease.

Uses

At extreme high pressure, water is used in many industrial cleaning applications requiring the removal of surface coatings and for dust-free cutting of some metals and concrete. For exterior applications, gas powered washers provide greater mobility than electric ones, as they do not require use in proximity to an electrical outlet. For indoor applications, electric washers produce no exhaust and are much quieter than gas or propane washers.

The majority of pressure washers nowadays connect to an existing water supply, like a garden hose, but some models store water in an attached tank. Usually there is an on/off button that controls the water stream and many models allow you to adjust the water pressure.

Pressure Washing vs Power Washing: What’s The Difference?



The terms pressure washing and power washing are often used interchangeably. So even if you’re a pro in the power washing domain, you yourself might not be clear on the question of pressure washing vs. power washing.

At first glance, it may seem that pressure washing is actually the same thing as power washing. However, when digging deeper, there seem to be some small differences between the two. But before we go into detail on those difference, it helps to better understand the basics behind high pressure water cleaning and what a high pressure washer is for.

Best Uses for a Pressure Washer

A pressure cleaner is the actual machine used in pressure washing. While it might seem like a niche market, the truth is that almost everyone is a potential pressure washing client. That’s because the service provided by a water pressure cleaner is far more necessary than you might originally imagine.

Think of what a pressure cleaner does – with its high-pressure water spray it is uniquely able to clean large surfaces, effectively removing dirt, dust, mud, grime, stains, salt, mold and even chewing gum. This makes an electric pressure washer perfect for cleaning:

Exterior facades of buildings, both residential and commercial

Sidewalks, stairways, walkways, patios, and driveways

Public spaces like stadiums, open air plazas, and parking garages

Cinemas with all their popcorn and soda stuck to the seats and grounds

Vehicles of all types, including cars, busses, trucks, and boats

In fact, using a pressure cleaner is one of the most effective ways to give a building a face-lift at a relatively low cost. It’s also one of the easiest ways to keep premises looking clean, on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Even individual private homeowners could use a blast from a pressure cleaner every now and then, to spruce up their place, and give it a nice new look (which is, of course, also excellent for maintaining property value).

Back to the Question of Pressure Washing vs. Power Washing

So now you know that pressure washing is great, but maybe you’re still wondering about power washing vs. pressure washing question. The only difference with power washing is the heat. To be more explicit, the jet wash in a power washing machine uses heated water, whereas the water in a pressure washer is not heated.

The advantage of a power washer’s heated water is felt most clearly in tough to clean spaces with serious grime, especially mildew, salt, and grease. The heated water makes it easier to clean surfaces – just as it does when doing dishes or washing your hands – and as such, the power washer is essentially as the more heavy-duty machine. It can more easily scrub spaces clean, and is therefore the preferred option for jobs that require a higher level of cleaning, or may begin in a more serious state of dirt, grime, or grease. It is particularly recommended on surfaces such as concrete, which will not be damaged by power washing.

Does Pressure Washing Require Insurance?

For most small business owners, it’s a good idea to take out business insurance, and pressure washers are no exception; customized pressure washing insurance is essential for success. The level of insurance, however, is up to your evaluation of your business’ risks and needs. It’s a good idea to look for an insurance policy that offers different options based on the size of your business and what sort of coverage you will require.

While we went into quite a bit of detail above about the small, yet significant, difference between pressure and power washing, it’s good to note that for insurance purposes they’re the same. That is, your insurance provider likely won’t be getting into the nitty-gritty of the differences, but offering you a plan based on the essence of the business.

PRESSURE WASHING YOUR DECK

You've rented a pressure washer, and the DIY-er in you is ready to go! After hooking up to your water supply, it shouldn't take much more than squeezing a nozzle-right?

Actually, pressure washing your deck can be a little more difficult than it might seem. There are safety issues to consider when you're using a pressure washer, of course, and you also want to make sure that you're not damaging your deck. When you're using a pressure washer to clean your deck, it's very easy to end up removing around 1/4" of the surface wood, which can be extremely difficult and costly to repair.

Still, regularly cleaning your deck is probably the most important part of its maintenance. And this maintenance will add years of life to your deck. Plus, it can save you loads of money and time in the long run.

Before you begin cleaning your deck, remember these key tips:

Less is more. You'll very rarely need any more than 1500 pounds per square inch (PSI) of pressure to clean your deck.

That amount of pressure is still enough to do significant damage to your wood. Start small, and focus on the technique.

The easiest way to keep the pressurized water from damaging your wood is to let your cleaner do most of the work.

Cleaners

Deck cleaners can come in many varieties. They could be a detergent, or they could be bleach, and there are even some chemical cleaners that are designed specifically for certain wood.

There's no black and white answer when it comes to choosing which cleaner you should use. But no matter which you choose, the most important thing to do is read the instructions for that cleaner carefully-and to follow those instructions. Also, your pressure washer should be used to remove the excess cleaner as much as it's used to remove the dirt.

Again, let your cleaner to most of the work.

Technique

When you first begin using your pressure cleaner, set the pressure fairly low. We recommend you start at around 600 PSI and work up from there as you need to. You want to make sure you have enough pressure to clean, but not enough to do any damage.

Now you're ready to start cleaning:

Start from about two feet above the surface of the deck, then slowly lower the wand to about 12" above the deck.

Use a sweeping motion to spray the deck. When you're sweeping, your arm will have a tendency to pivot, but try to resist that. You should attempt to keep a level and consistent distance from the surface of the deck at all times.

Move from the house outward, and always spray with the grain to minimize the amount of damage you do to the wood grains.

Overlap the areas that you've just finished cleaning with the areas that you're beginning to clean. This technique is called "feathering" and it will help to prevent any visible marks left behind from pressure washing, often called "hot spots" or "cleaning edges".

Once you've completed the work, allow the deck around 24 hours to dry before checking your work. Decks will have a very different appearance depending on whether they're wet or dry, and you'll want to be sure that everything looks okay before you call the job done. Inspect your work, making sure that you haven't left behind any cleaning edges, and that you've cleaned every part of the deck.

Then, you'll want to take care of...

Wood Fibers

There's no getting around it: when wood gets wet, the wood fibers will raise up. Hopefully, you've done minimal damage to the wood, and you won't notice too much of a problem with the fibers. But even a small amount of raised fibers can mean serious problems with splinters.

To keep your deck as hand- and foot-friendly as possible, you'll want to sand your deck after the cleaning is done. If you inspect the deck and find very minimal wood fiber exposure, you may just need to spot sand it. On the other hand, it may be best to sand the entire deck.

Use an orbital sander with a 5" pad.

For the deck surface, use a 60- to 80-grit sandpaper.

For your handrails, use no higher than a 100-grit sandpaper.

Pressure washing your deck may be more difficult than it seems. However, with the proper knowledge, tools, and techniques, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to get a quality job done.

Save Time and Money, and Cut Back on Waste Water

There are many benefits to using power pressure washers as opposed to a traditional garden hose. Among the major benefits is the ability to cut down on waste water. With the ever-increasing price of water and the growing need to cut back on usage, now it's more important than ever to improve pressure cleaning efficiency.

Hotsy pressure cleaning equipment saves water in two ways. First, our pressure washers use fewer gallons of water per minute. The flow of water out of the typical garden hose faucet is 8 gallons per minute. When you use a standard spray gun, you can reduce the flow from 8 gallons per minute to about 5 gallons per minute. In doing so, the pressure of the water increases from 10 PSI (pounds per square inch) to 50 PSI.

When you reduce the flow of water from 8 gallons per minute to just 5 gallons, you automatically increase the pressure. The more pressure you have, the stronger the stream (up to five times stronger with a garden hose spray nozzle), which means faster, more efficient cleaning. The faster you clean the less water you use—it's that simple.

Now, when you choose a Hotsy pressure washer, you can increase the PSI by leaps and bounds over a standard hose. The average pressure washer uses 2 to 3 gallons of water per minute. The pressure washer pump creates intense pressure—generally about 1500 to 2000 PSI

This high-pressure water stream quickly and easily blasts away dirt, grime, and debris, greatly reducing the time needed to complete a cleaning job. When you complete the cleaning job quickly, you use less water. When you increase the pressure and reduce the gallons of water used per minute, you save water. A Hotsy pressure cleaning system can reduce your water usage by at least 75 percent or more!

WHY YOU SHOULDN’T DO IT YOURSELF

Want your home to look its best? You should consider our professional pressure washing services. By power washing your deck, siding, driveway, and other exterior areas around your home, you can quickly and effectively remove built-up dirt, sediment, and other debris. This not only helps the areas look beautiful, but it can also reduce wear and tear by getting rid of mold, algae, chalk, insects, weeds, and more. Such build-up will, over time, break down and cause damage to wood / masonry and degrade paint / stains.

You may be tempted to pressure wash your own home, but the truth is it can be a costly, frustrating, and time-consuming endeavor. Most pressure washers cost $100 per day to rent. You will also have to travel to the rental location, stand in line, get the machine ready, clean the machine, refuel the machine, and return it by the deadline. Instead, contact Mr. Handyman, and we will arrive with the machine, as well as all of the other necessary equipment and detergents / degreasers, and expertly clean the area for you.
