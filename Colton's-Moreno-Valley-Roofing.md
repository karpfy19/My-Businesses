Roofing Tips for First Time Homeowners

Roofing Tip #1: Spring Clean Your Roof

Don’t just spring clean the inside of your house! Making sure that your roof is free of debris is essential. Fall, winter, and, spring can wreak havoc with mountains of leaves, snow storms blowing down branches, not to mention bomb cyclones carrying shingles off to Oz.

Cleaning your roof is important. If your pitch is low enough, you may be able to handle that task on your own, but keep in mind, that roof is a lot higher than you think. Not to mention, shingles and other roofing material can be very slippery when damp, so if you attempt to remove branches and leaves on your own, wait until it is good and dry. When you are getting the leaves off your roof, make sure and sweep in a downward motion and make sure that you are secure on your ladder or scaffolding.

Roofing Tip #2: Gut Your Gutters

Full gutters are a huge factor in leaks and roof damage, so making sure those are clean after the fall colors have faded is equally important. Likewise, gutters may end up pulling away from your house and in the long run, will lead to water running down into your foundation.

Before those April showers and for your own peace of mind, you might schedule a standing appointment with a roofer at the end of a long winter to give your gutters and roof some spring cleaning. At the very least, get an estimate. It might just be worth your time and your money to let someone else handle sweeping the roof and cleaning the gutters.

Roofing Tip #3: Roof Mold, Moss & Algae

Other types of debris that are common in areas where lots of trees grow, like Michigan where I live, are mold, moss, and algae. Allowing these to continue to grow on your roof will shorten the longevity of your roof and allow water to pool which is never a good thing. You don’t want to use a power-washer nor do you want to use a stiff bristled brush or broom because it will damage your shingles and will shorten their life.

Find a good cleaner for moss and use it to kill the moss before sweeping it off, or better yet, call someone and have your roofer do that dirty job for you.

Roofing Tip #4: Inspect Your Attic

After you have checked your roof on the outside, make sure and periodically check the inside of your roof.  If your roof has any leaks or damage, sometimes the easiest way to spot it is from the interior.  Check out your attic spaces for any water damage, the smell of mildew or mold, and any visible signs of light from any small holes in the roof. Include this task with your monthly or bi-monthly to do list. 

Roofing Tip #5: Go Looking For Trouble

One of the most troublesome areas in roofing, along with the gutters, is the chimney. The chimney often has flashing around it and roofing materials butted up against it as well. Checking to make sure the flashing and shingles are up tight against the chimney and waterproof is an important part of roof maintenance.

Because of the height of most chimneys, this might be something you will want to leave up to the professionals.

Roofing Tip #6: Look For Small Aesthetic Flaws In Your Roof

When you are inspecting your roof, you need to look for small superficial flaws that can lead to huge, costly issues. Look for shingles that are bald. Also, be on the lookout for any nails that have come up and that are protruding. A good pair of binoculars is not a bad tool to have when examining your roof.

Keeping your roof on your mind is an important part of being a homeowner, but it doesn’t have to be an all-consuming or daunting task. Put it on your calendar and keep these tips handy as you do your inspections. If your roof needs some upkeep, then you have another decision to make. If you decide to do the maintenance on your roof yourself, please take all the safety precautions you can.

When choosing a professional, make sure you have a reputable contractor. Check with vetting agencies, like ImproveNet and get recommendations. Roof repairs are important, so you want the best to help you avoid any large costs in the future. An ounce of prevention not only keeps the doctor away, but it will keep your roof looking good and functioning at its best because we all know, there really is, “no place like home.”

Asphalt vs Metal Roofing

Arguably the most important surface in your entire home, a roof endures the most direct weather exposure and plays the biggest role in protecting you and your family from the elements. Roofs block rain, wind, hail and snow. They also catch most of the sunlight and help to provide insulation to keep the house warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

With such an important role in the functioning of your home, it is essential that you have a roof that not only looks good, but one that also performs well under stress.

Having a damaged roof can be costly in more ways than just the repair costs. The roof repair itself might not be cheap, but that usually pales in comparison to the secondary damage done to your other items. A leaky roof can leave your furniture ruined, your flooring destroyed, and even cause damage to your electrical grid should you be unlucky. With this in mind, most home owners value durability of a roof over anything else and when deciding between asphalt and metal that decision can be tough.

Asphalt

Traditionally, asphalt shingles have been the go-to roofing material for residential use, and until recently it would be strange to suggest anything else. Though asphalt is very heavy, the cost of materials and installation is usually very low compared to other options, which is the highest selling point. Additionally, asphalt can come in a variety of styles, so it fits well on most houses.

One unique quality of shingled, asphalt roofs is that it is actually not overly difficult to make the installation into a do-it-yourself project. This can attract the more daring home owner, and certainly provides a level of appeal should damage occur. If you do learn how to properly install this type of roofing, rather than having to pay for repairs should they be needed, you can just as easily climb up on the roof and do it yourself.

Overall, asphalt is certainly the less expensive option for roofing, but in some cases they can last 50 years or even more. Still, buyers should be aware that, in many locations around Canada, a roof that is warrantied for 50 years may only last for half of that time. Despite this, asphalt will stand up to most adverse weather conditions, and with virtually any color option available, they can go well with most home design plans.

Metal

Though they have been used in commercial and industry use for some time, it is only recently that the residential market has really embraced metal roofs. It was a tough start at first, because the reality is that cheap metal roofs are just that; cheap. Fortunately for potential buyers, a quality metal roof actually has many great qualities, not the least of which is their extreme longevity.

In most cases, a metal roof will last a good 100 years, much longer than any asphalt roof. Furthermore, unless you purchase the cheapest metal you can find, these roofs offer superior protection against the elements. One of their more unique selling points, metal roofs can also be fashioned into just about any roofing design you can imagine, and can even be made to imitate shingles.

Overall, metal roofs are a very solid and reliable option, but their Achilles heel lies in the price. Even a cheap metal roof is going to cost as much as expensive asphalt and most people don't want to settle for the cheap metal. If you are able to budget for it though, a good metal roof can certainly be a great option for your home.

The Comparison

When it comes down to longevity, you will have a hard time finding a roof that lasts longer than a well-made metal roof. Additionally, these metal roofs can come in a very wide variety of styles and colors, some even looking like the asphalt roofs that are so popular. On the other hand, these higher end metal roofs can cost two, three, or even four times as much as their asphalt cousins.

For those looking to get cheaper metal roofing, there have also been cases of poor performance under high wind and rain or snowy conditions, which can be a problem depending on the weather where you live. Furthermore, these cheaper metal roofs will often leave the owners hearing each and every drop of rain, and can look downright ugly on top of a home. Despite this, if money is no issue, there are plenty of designs that look quite attractive and offer not only superior performance under extreme weather but also a comfortable and quiet feel.

Which One is Best?

Depending on the weather conditions in your area and your budget, the answer to this question could be different. On one hand, metal is stronger overall, but the cheaper metal roofs are going to be more prone to wind and hail damage than their asphalt counterparts. On the other hand, asphalt is almost always going to be cheaper than metal, and in some cases can last well past the 30- or 40-year warranty that comes with them.

Ultimately, the factors that affect most buyers' decisions are the cost and the presentation. The simple reality is that if money is no issue, metal is going to be the longer lasting and better choice. If you do have to stay within a budget though, don't let the claims of these metal roofing companies discourage you; asphalt is still a solid roofing option.

Choosing the Right Roof
 
Better on a budget

The first thing to consider is how much you have to spend on your new roof. All roofs are NOT created equal, and neither is the cost of purchasing and installing them. Composition shingles in asphalt or fiberglass provide a durable surface that's relatively easy and inexpensive to install and maintain. Wood shakes are another attractive and affordable choice, although they require more upkeep, and may not be right for every style of home. On the other hand, if you've got money to burn, you may want to consider a high-end material such as clay, slate, or tile. While the high cost can be a downside, low maintenance and long lifespan more than make up for it.

Home style

Boost your curb appeal by taking the color and architectural style of your home into consideration when making roofing decisions. Own a Cape-cod? Coastal homes are often topped with bright colors like red and blue. For Spanish-style homes, clay tile is the traditional choice.  If you belong to a homeowners or community organization, there may be rules regarding the color and type of roofing you may use, so be sure to check the guidelines before making your decision.

Environmentally-friendly

Want to get back to nature? Green roofs are a great way to do it. Eco-roofs may consist of a number of different plant types, and can be obtained in pre-grown modules and trays for easy installation. Some companies will even â€œgrowâ€ a new roof to your specifications. Whether you want grass or flowers, your green roof will help to save energy, produce life-giving oxygen, and remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere.

Color your world

Choosing a new shingle color (and there are now many to choose from) is an easy way to brighten up a dull color scheme. Blue and grey houses often look best with black or dark grey shingles, as do white houses, if you are going for a traditional look. Consider brown or a combination of brown and cream shingles if your home is tan, brown, or cream in color. Own a yellow, red, or green home? Grey, brown, or black are generally the best choices. As a general rule, always try to coordinate the color of your roofing with the colors you find in other elements of your home.

Some like it hot

The overall weather conditions in your area are another thing to consider when choosing new roofing. To live comfortably in a warm region, a roof which reflects, rather than absorbs the sun's rays can help you save big on cooling costs. Slate, clay, terra cotta, and concrete tiles are excellent choices when it comes to keeping cool, although the cost and added weight may be a concern for some homeowners. Flat, white tiles in ceramic, concrete, or composed of a composite material can reflect up to 77 percent of the sun's rays, and cut monthly AC costs substantially. White metal roofing is also a good way to keep things cool. While the cost is generally higher than that of some traditional roofing materials, low maintenance, durability, and energy savings more than compensate for the upfront costs.

Thar she blows!

If you live in an area that is often subject to high winds, heavy snowfall, pounding rain, hail, or other fun things that Mother Nature can throw at you, you need roofing that can take a beating. Metal roofing is increasing in popularity in regions prone to heavy snowfall because it allows snow and ice to slide off, and saves on heating costs when properly-insulated. It is also a durable choice in areas where high winds occur, as are heavy-duty asphalt shingles. Concrete tiles can take a pounding, so they may be a good choice where heavy rains are common. * Passive and active solar paneling are also good options, and actually work most efficiently in cooler climates.

*Concrete tiles are three-times heavier than asphalt shingles, so be sure that your home can support the added weight before installing them. Avoid metal roofing in seaside areas where they are prone to rust, and forego cement tile in areas of heavy snowfall, as snow will not slide off easily.
 
Show your metal

Metal has become an increasingly popular roofing choice over the past few years*. Metal roofing comes in three basic styles: standing seam types requiring crimping and soldering during installation, screw-down panel versions, and metals that mimic slate, tile, or cedar. While initially more expensive than some other types of roofing, going metal means no more worries about mold, mildew, chipping, or cracking. Metal roofing has can help to lower your heating and cooling because it provides good insulation, and gives you the added security of fire resistance as well. Metal roofing has a long-life expectancy, so it may be well over half a century before it needs to be replaced.
