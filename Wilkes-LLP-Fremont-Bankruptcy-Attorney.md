What Does a Bankruptcy Attorney Do?

The word bankruptcy is so fraught with negative images that consumers tend to forget the real purpose behind filing: A) It provides protection from creditors; and B) It offers relief from some, or maybe even all debt obligations.

And that is exactly what a bankruptcy lawyer should do: Protect your assets from debt collectors and find a way to free you from financial responsibilities.

While it’s permissible to file for bankruptcy “pro se” – on your own – statistics say you will get a much happier result if you hire an attorney, regardless of whether you choose Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

According to Ed Flynn of the American Bankruptcy Institute, lawyers represented consumers in 91.5% of the 486,347 Chapter 7 cases filed in 2017. Lawyers had their clients debt discharged – meaning eliminated – in 96.2% of the cases.  Put another way: 428,097 people walked out of court debt free.

By contrast, people who represented themselves in Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, were successful just 66.7% of the time.

The stats are even more dramatic for consumers who chose Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Consumers representing themselves succeeded just 2.3% of the time. That number soared to a 41.5% success rate -- debts were discharged after completing a repayment plan – when a lawyer represented a client in a Chapter 13 case.

So, if your financial status has soured and you want protection from creditors and relief from debt obligations, a bankruptcy lawyer could be your ticket to a fresh start.

What Should I Expect from a Bankruptcy Attorney?

Bankruptcy, like most legal matters, is a process and the safest route is to have an attorney guide you through the process if you want to succeed.

A good bankruptcy attorney will give you peace of mind if they provide at least these four things:

An initial consultation – usually free! – to get an overview of your case

Advice on options available, including what type of bankruptcy to file

Completed paperwork necessary for filing bankruptcy

Representation when the case goes to court

The bankruptcy process begins with a 30-60 minute interview between you and a lawyer. If you are married, both of you should attend so that all questions can be answered honestly and accurately.

Making guesses about how much you owe and who you owe it to is not a good idea. The attorney will want some paperwork that backs up your answers on how many assets you have and how much you owe. Don’t hold anything back if you want an honest and accurate assessment of your situation.

When the attorney has enough documented evidence to evaluate your case, he should offer advice on how to proceed. A good attorney does not always recommend filing bankruptcy. It’s possible your problem could be resolved through less drastic means like debt settlement or maybe even a debt management program.

If your decision is to file bankruptcy, the next thing to expect from an attorney is filing paperwork with the court. Remember that the attorney is there to protect as many of your assets as he/she can, so chime in on what is most important to you.

Then, there is the matter of appearing before a judge. The lawyer should be experienced enough to give judges convincing evidence that you made some mistakes, have learned your lesson and will do much better financially if the judge will give you a second chance. This often is no problem in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but can get tricky in Chapter 13 when the lawyer must lay out a plausible payment plan that you can complete in less than five years.

Do I Need a Bankruptcy Attorney?

Consumers may choose whether to hire an attorney or represent themselves in filing bankruptcy, but as the numbers cited above from the American Bankruptcy Institute clearly demonstrate, hiring an attorney is a huge advantage.

The math on this subject is overwhelming:

Only one in 25 consumers using an attorney loses a case when filing Chapter 7. One out of three who files on their own, loses in Chapter 7 cases.

Only about one in 50 consumers filing for themselves in Chapter 13, wins a case. Hire a lawyer and your chance for success is better than four-out-of-10.

The reasons are fairly obvious. Bankruptcy is a complex subject. Creditors want to get paid by consumers who say they don’t have the money. Lawyers on both sides are trying to convince judges that their client is right.

If you are not experienced in filing legal documents or arguing your case persuasively, you could lose on ridiculously simple mistakes. An experienced attorney knows what papers must be filed and what deadlines must be met. An experienced attorney knows the judges involved and what arguments they must make to get the result.

That is why hiring an attorney has so much higher a success rate that attempts to file on your own.

Can a Consumer Seriously Consider Doing This Pro Se?

If you have a great deal of time, patience and commitment – not to mention an understanding of legal proceedings and language – it is possible to file for bankruptcy pro se (on your own) and be successful.

It is not advisable, but it is possible.

Bankruptcy cases are tried in federal courts and that creates a problem right away. To file a case, you need to code your petition in a certain way or it will never get on a judge’s docket.

There is the matter of filing all paperwork necessary for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcies. Excluding even one document can result in your case being dismissed.

The U.S. Court System has made the process a little easier by furnishing a fillable PDF form that can be used in presenting a Chapter 13 filing. Eventually, they expect to have all necessary forms available online and that presumably will make it easier for pro se filers to handle filing their own case.

Then there is the matter of arguing your case before a judge, who knows the law, procedures and remedies for situations and could choose to dismiss your case at anytime if you don’t follow those.

So, yes, you can consider filing a bankruptcy case yourself, but know that you’re doing so at your own risk.

Signs That You Need a Bankruptcy Lawyer

Financial distress rarely happens overnight or unexpectedly. It’s usually a gradual process with several flare warnings going up that things are deteriorating.

When warnings are ignored, your finances can go up in smoke and it’s too late to do anything about it other than declare bankruptcy.

Some of the obvious signs that bankruptcy might be in your future include:

You only make minimum monthly payments on overdue bills

Your credit cards are maxed out and debt is growing, not shrinking each month

You use credit cards to pay every day expenses like groceries, rent or utilities

You’re paying overdraft fees each month

Collection agencies are calling your house day and night

Creditors are suing you or threatening to sue over your unpaid debts

You don’t qualify for debt-relief programs like debt management or debt consolidation loans

A job loss, divorce or medical setback turns your finances upside down

Bankruptcy is universally considered a last-ditch solution for financial problems for good reasons. It can damage your credit for anywhere from 7-10 years; be an obstacle toward getting security clearances; and may cause you to miss out on work opportunities.

However, if you can’t resolve your problems in less than five years, bankruptcy is a viable option.

How Much Do Bankruptcy Lawyers Charge?

Lawyer fees for bankruptcy vary depending on which form you choose, how complex your case is and where you are geographically.

The standard rate for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is $1,500 and $3,500 for Chapter 13. Other costs include a filing fee ($335 for Chapter 7; $310 for Chapter 13); and fees for credit counseling and financial management courses, which both cost from $20 to $100.

Tips on Selecting a Bankruptcy Lawyer

Since debtors filing for bankruptcy generally don't have much money, it is probably best, when selecting a lawyer, to shop around for the lowest price. Although the quality of a lawyer may be very important in a complex case, such as for an auto accident, bankruptcy is mostly routine, and virtually any lawyer who specializes in bankruptcy should be able to competently perform all the duties necessary. Indeed, most lawyers simply have their legal secretary fill out the forms.

It would help to be familiar with bankruptcy procedure, so that you can explain to the lawyer exactly what your case involves, and what may be a problem. For instance, if you are filing for Chapter 7 and do not have any nonexempt assets, informing your prospective lawyer of this will allow her to give you a much better estimate of the cost reflecting the work that will probably be required. If the attorney is unwilling to give you an accurate quote over the phone or in response to email, then continue your search, since the lawyer is probably not being honest, and simply wants you to go her office rather than continuing to shop around.

A good way to search for a lawyer is to use a search engine such as Google, and type in terms bankruptcy lawyer and your county or zip code, then print out the list and call each one. Not only can you get a better idea of what prices they charge, but you can see how they respond to your phone call:

Are they helpful?

Can you talk to the lawyer herself?

Is she friendly?

Most bankruptcy cases are not complicated. There are several books that allow the debtor to file for bankruptcy pro se (aka in pro per) by representing himself. These books give step-by-step procedures for filling out most of the forms of a bankruptcy petition, and handle some of the most common problems that arise for most debtors. Nonetheless, there are many people who do not feel comfortable representing themselves, especially since they have never fully witnessed the process. Some debtors may also have problems that are more complicated or not routine, and that may require the services of a bankruptcy attorney.

In addition to the attorney's fee, there is the court fee for filing the bankruptcy petition — $274 for Chapter 13 filing and $299 for a Chapter 7 — and also the fees for credit counseling and personal debt management, which, combined, will usually total about $100.

Generally, an attorney giving full representation to a debtor will file the bankruptcy petition electronically and get most the information about the debtor's creditors from his credit reports.

A bankruptcy lawyer can also help the debtor to file or respond to motions, which are requests to the court by the debtor or other party-in-interest, usually a creditor, to take some action or to rule on a contested statement.

An attorney can also ensure that there are no problems with the bankruptcy petition, not only with the forms themselves, but also with any appraisals or other requirements that the judge or the trustee may require, because the lawyer generally knows what they want.

Why a Bankruptcy Attorney Is Worth the Cost

The biggest benefit to you is that an experienced attorney quickly recognizes any potential hiccup that could arise during your case and will plan accordingly. Here’s a sampling of the value a qualified consumer bankruptcy attorney will bring to the table.

Bankruptcy Planning:

Consider alternatives to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy might not be the only way to achieve financial peace. If bankruptcy is not the best choice, your attorney will suggest an appropriate bankruptcy alternative.

Decide which type of bankruptcy to file. Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 accomplish different goals and serve different purposes. For instance, Chapter 7 will wipe out a lot of debt in a short time, but it won’t help you save a house if you’re behind on your payments. Your attorney will carefully consider your wants and needs and will recommend a course to help you achieve those goals. (For more information, see Should I File for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 Bankruptcy?)

Bankruptcy Preparation:

Apply the means test. The means test calculation indicates whether you qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy or whether you can afford to make payments in a Chapter 13 case. An attorney will understand how to use any special circumstances you present.

Value your property. Do you know how to value your dining room set or your 5-year-old TV? Your attorney will make sure that you disclose and value your assets realistically.

Choose and apply exemptions. Every state has a separate exemption system used to keep property in bankruptcy. Your attorney will understand how to use the exemption rules to protect as much of your assets as possible.

Determine Discharge of Debts. Some debts don’t get wiped out (discharged) in bankruptcy. Others go away only if certain conditions get met. Your attorney will explain which debts will get eliminated and which will survive your case.

How Many People File Without an Attorney?

Filing pro se or pro per (without a lawyer), is somewhat unusual. In 2015, 9.2% of people who filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and 8.5% of those filing a Chapter 13 case filed on their own. Even more significant is the ultimate success rate. According to reports issued by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, fewer than 2% of pro se Chapter 13 filers are able to get a repayment plan confirmed (approved by the court) as compared to 60% of debtors represented by an attorney.

During Your Bankruptcy:

Complete the schedules and other paperwork. You will file pages of financial data about your debts, income, expenses, assets, and recent financial transactions, all under penalty of perjury. Your attorney will know what you must disclose, how to value your assets, what constitutes income, which of your expenses are “reasonable and necessary,” which tax returns to supply, and a host of other issues.

Guide you through the bankruptcy case. Your attorney will explain and prepare you for what's ahead, like the role of the bankruptcy trustee and the judge, the steps you must take to qualify for a discharge, and what actions your creditors can take.

Provide accurate and complete testimony. You must sign your bankruptcy paperwork under penalty of perjury, telling the court that as far as you know, the information is correct. At your meeting of creditors and anytime you're in court, you’ll swear or affirm that you’re telling the truth. Your attorney will be with you to ensure that your testimony is correct and complete.

Handle creditors who violate the automatic stay. Some creditors just don’t know when to quit collecting. If a creditor violates the automatic stay (the injunctive order that prohibits collection activity after the filing of the case), your attorney can demand compliance or ask the court to hold the creditor in contempt.

Negotiate with your creditors. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, your attorney can negotiate a reaffirmation agreement or a redemption with a secured creditor that will allow you to keep your house or car. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, your attorney will negotiate with your creditors on payment terms, the value of collateral (property that secures payment of a debt), and interest rates to make your repayment plan affordable.
