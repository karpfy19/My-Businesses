 Maintaining Your Lawn

Finally, we get to the meat of the matter. If you've got the right soil, and you've planted the right grass, how do you keep your lawn mean and green?

There are eight major components to lawn maintenance:

Watering

Mowing

Fertilizing

Fighting weeds

Fighting pests

Fighting disease

Aerating

De-thatching

Watering is simple. The general rule is to water heavily, when the lawn really needs it, rather than watering lightly more frequently. If you water lightly, the water won't make it down into the soil so it won't do much good. You should water enough to soak 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) deep, encouraging the roots to grow deep into the ground. Watering recommendations vary between different soil types, but as a general rule, water until there is about an inch of water (2.5 cm) over the ground surface.

Water as soon as the grass starts to dry out. Its color will change from green to bluish grey, and it will lose some of its bounce. If the grass doesn't spring back a few seconds after you step on it, it needs water. The best time to water is in the early morning; the water won't evaporate as easily as in the afternoon, and it will cool the lawn down as temperatures start to climb.

Mowing reduces the workload on a grass plant's root system. A large culm above-ground requires more water and nutrients from underground. It's easier for the roots to provide for the plant if the culm is smaller. Mowing also encourages the grass plant to expand. When the blades cut down the leaves, the plant has to grow new leaves to absorb sunlight. This helps build a thicker, heavier lawn, which is more resistant to weeds and disease.

It's best to mow frequently during the growing season. The rule of thumb is to never cut off more than a third of the grass plant at once -- it's bad for the plant to lose a lot of its photosynthesizing ability suddenly. One common mowing mistake is cutting the grass too short. It's best to keep cool-season grasses at about 3 inches (7.5 cm) high or taller, and most warm-season grasses do well at about 2 or 2.5 inches (5 to 6.5 cm) high. You may want to vary the mowing height throughout the year. In fall, winter and spring, you can mow closer because temperatures are cool and water is more abundant. In the summer, let the grass grow longer. The shade will help cool the soil.

Lawn care experts recommend varying your mowing pattern. That is, push the mower north and south one week and east and west the next week. Sharpen your mower blades a couple of times a year to ensure a healthy, clean cut. If you have a mulching mower, you can leave the clippings on the lawn to help fertilize the grass.

Periodic Maintenance

In addition to mowing and watering regularly, you'll need to make time for several larger jobs throughout the year.

Fertilizing

Fertilizing adds nutrients to the soil so that the soil can provide nutrients to the grass. If you mow regularly, your grass will grow very quickly, which means it needs more nutrients than an average plant. Your soil can provide nutrients for most native plants by itself, but it may need some help to feed your grass.

The most effective way to fertilize is to spread slow-acting commercial granular fertilizer once or twice a year. Unlike water-soluble spray fertilizer, which acts on the leaves directly, granular fertilizer releases nutrients gradually over several months. If you spread the fertilizer in the fall, it will strengthen the plant's root structure, making it more resilient to drought and more resistant to weeds. You can also add natural fertilizer, such as compost and manure.

Aerating

When soil gets compacted -- from foot traffic, mowing and the like -- oxygen can't reach the microbes that break down organic matter to enrich the soil. To keep your lawn healthy, it's a good idea to aerate it periodically -- to open up the compacted soil.

Manual and power core-aerators remove narrow sections of soil to form shallow holes. Air, water and organic material spread into the ground through the holes, revitalizing the soil. If heavy traffic compacts your lawn severely, it's best to aerate it every spring or fall.

De-thatching

In any lawn, thatch material collects around the base of the grass plants. Thatch is not made up of mowed grass clippings, as is commonly believed. Clippings usually break down in a week or so. Thatch is actually made up of culms and crowns that have died naturally.

A small amount of thatch helps conserve water in the soil by blocking evaporation, but heavy thatch build-up (more than a quarter-inch / 6 mm thick) keeps air and water from ever reaching the soil. If there's too much thatch on your lawn, rake it up or rent a power de-thatcher.

Weeding

Weeding is an ongoing process, but it shouldn't take much time once you establish a healthy lawn. Grass, especially modern mixtures, is extremely competitive and will crowd out most weeds itself. If a lot of weeds do pop up, take it as a sign that your grass is weaker than it should be. This could mean your soil is deficient or water-logged, or it could mean you're cutting the grass too short.

Weeds will also pop up in a healthy lawn, of course. For the most part, this isn't anything to worry about. Almost all lawns have weeds, and they don't do much harm in small numbers. Simply pull up any weeds that detract from the lawn's appearance. If you have a larger weed problem, spray the individual weeds with a low-toxicity herbicide. Don't spray the entire lawn unless you have weeds throughout.

Pest Control

Pest control is similar to weed control. If you have a healthy, thriving lawn, you shouldn't have to worry about it. Bugs will make their home in your lawn, but they won't be able to damage the grass much.

From time to time, however, bugs may destroy some of your grass. You can treat infestations by spraying insecticide or certain bacteria (namely, Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt). Only use insecticides that kill harmful insects specifically. Ants and spiders prey on lawn pests, so you certainly want to keep them around. Check out this site for more information.

Fighting Disease

Diseased lawns are usually caused by fungi feeding on the grass plants. Healthy grass stands up to fungus very well, but it develops disease now and then. Fight persistent or widespread fungi with a fungicide, available at any garden center. This site explains how to identify and fight common lawn diseases.

Lawn care is as complex as you want to make it. If you must have your own personal golf course in the backyard, you might devote many hours a week to your yard. If you just want something covering the ground, you could plant native grasses that pretty much take care of themselves. The links in the next section will show you the available options and expand on these basic guidelines for proper maintenance.

WHAT'S WEED AND FEED?

"Weed and feed" products are simply a combination of herbicide chemicals and fertilizer chemicals. These products may contain pre-emergent herbicides, which kill weeds that haven't sprouted yet, or post-emergent herbicides, which kill grown weed plants. Some weed and feed mixtures also contain pesticides. Just like "shampoo and conditioner in one" products, the idea of weed and feed is to cut down on lawn care time by giving you everything you need in one bottle.

Garden experts warn that this usually isn't the best approach to feeding and weeding. For one thing, the optimum fertilizing time is different from the optimum weed-killing time in most areas. More importantly, applying herbicide all over your lawn is overkill when you only have isolated weeds, and the chemicals can damage the environment. In most cases, applying fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide more precisely, when it is needed, is a better lawn care strategy.

Spring Lawn Care Tips

Spring is the season when your lawn needs maximum attention after it has endured all the harsh conditions of winter. Whatever you do during this season will determine how healthy or unhealthy your lawn looks for the next several months.

Feeding in the spring

After winter, your lawn may begin to turn greener, but don’t apply fertilizer just yet. According to the University of Connecticut’s Home & Garden Education Center, you should wait until your grass actually grows before you can start fertilizing it. The reason for this is that its roots still store enough carbohydrates from last fall to facilitate early spring growth. As a general rule of thumb, fertilizer tends to be more useful after a plant has exhausted its own resources.

For the best results, go for organic or light, slow-release types of fertilizers to ensure you’re not burning your possibly weakened lawn (after the harsh winter weather). Besides, liquid feeds and tonics are more recommended than granular fertilizers for quicker absorption by the plants. If you’re unsure about the most appropriate fertilization schedule to use for proper lawn care during spring, don’t hesitate to consult a professional lawn care professional for advice.

Watering in the spring

You should water your lawn no more than an inch a week. During this season, there’s still a lot of moisture in the soil, and you can test this by digging into the soil using a screwdriver. If the tool goes in with relative ease, then your lawn isn’t parched yet.

If you live in an area with regular rainfall, avoid turning your sprinkler system back on. Overwatering your lawn will drown the roots and encourage weed growth. The best time to start watering your lawn in spring is after grass starts to show signs of wilting. It is during this time that plants grow more and deeper roots which come in handy during those extended dry periods later in the summer.

Overseeding in the spring

Overseeding is the process of replenishing grass by scattering grass seeds over a lawn. Spring is a good time to overseed, particularly if you’re using turf grasses that are known to grow robustly in these conditions.

However, there is a debate on whether overseeding for cool-season turfgrasses is effective or not during spring. New seeds for these kinds of grasses only tend to grow shallow roots since the higher temperatures in the following summer cause photorespiration. This is the process where a plant uses more energy than it manufactures. But if your lawn has warm-season turfgrasses, then overseeding is generally recommended around this time.

Under normal circumstances, you’ll only need to overseed twice a year unless your lawn suffered severe damage in winter.

Pest control in the spring

As the spring weather warms the soil, earthworms and other bugs emerge toward the upper soil levels—but moles can return as well. Moles attack and damage the root systems of lawns in their search for worms and other food. Most moles in North America are found in the eastern U.S. and Canada. The most common family of moles in the U.S. is the Eastern mole—generally found in the Southeast and Northeast.

They’re a pest throughout spring, summer, and fall. However, the best time to lay mole traps is during the spring just before they build more tunnels. According to UConn’s Home & Garden Education Center, homeowners need to simply place a harpoon trap in the main tunnel, use a toxic bait (which is usually gummy-worm shaped), or try these other recommended methods.

Weed control in the spring

Weeds, such as crabgrass, begin to germinate during late spring and emerge fully during the summer, but you can curb and eliminate their presence. The product you’ll need to use here is pre-emergent herbicide. According to Pennsylvania State University’s Center for Turfgrass Science, the pre-emergent herbicide is the most critical component of an effective chemical control program. These herbicides are readily found in supermarkets and should be applied 10-14 days before the germination periods of weeds.

Later on in spring, you may consider using post-emergent herbicides to control any grassy or broadleaf weeds that often show up during summer.

Dethatching and aeration in the spring

Remove any leaves and twigs that might have accumulated on your lawn over the winter using leaf rakes and similar tools. Cleaning up these old debris paves the way for easy application of herbicides and fertilizers.

Also, don’t forget to aerate the soil on a day when soil is slightly damp but not soaked. This helps to ensure that oxygen, water, and nutrients from feeds reach roots for healthy lawn growth.

Spring lawn diseases

The University of Wisconsin compiled a list of common lawn diseases throughout all four seasons. During spring, there are four diseases to watch out for including Snow Mold (if your area receives snowfall), Necrotic Ring Spot, Fairy Rings, and Red Thread. 

Summer Lawn Care Tips

When it comes to lawn care, the majority, if not all, of us do it with summer in mind. It is during this season that lawns are used intensively as nearly everyone is spending more time outdoors and having lots of fun. As you can imagine, your lawn also is likely to suffer the most during this time due to the longer and drier days as well as increased foot traffic. But don’t worry as we’re about to show you easy tips to help you keep this space in its best possible condition.

Mowing in the summer

Mowing height adjustment is probably the most important practice to prepare lawns for hot weather. The reason is that lawns maintained at taller lengths, at least three inches or slightly higher, develop deeper root systems. Avoid mowing too frequently, especially if your lawn has cool-season turfgrasses. Their growth naturally slows down when temperatures become hotter and drier. Weekly mowing is reasonable and recommended. This will prevent you from cutting more than a third of the grass blade at a time which is key in keeping your grass looking healthier and stronger.

If you have cool-season grass in your lawn, mow it at 3-4 inches while for warm-season grass, that level should be down to about 2-3 inches high. After mowing, leave the clippings as mulch to keep moisture levels steady throughout the hot days.

Always use sharp mower blades to ensure that you’re cutting and not tearing the grass. Dull blades can harm and increase stress to your grass which is exactly what you want to avoid with all the unforgiving summer heat. 

Let’s admit it; a healthy and lush lawn is every homeowner’s dream. It not only improves the general appearance and value of your home but also prozvides a space for your family and friends to enjoy. Lawn care, like many other home maintenance tasks, calls for proper preparation and planning if you’re to have an enviable lawn throughout the year.
