Trimming and Pruning

Reasons for pruning:

Removing hazardous dead limbs that can damage property or cause injury when they fall,

promote new growth and tree health, control shape and aesthetic quality,

increase strength by eliminating weak branches, improve your view for line of sight safety

or curb appeal, reduce mold & mildew build up on roof and siding, branches rubbing against

your house or roof, and the most common reason, trimming branches away from your house

helps prevent squirrels, rats, and similar pests from getting into your house.

Types of tree trimming and pruning:

Raising the Canopy:

In this type of tree trimming only the lower limbs on a tree are removed.

This is the most popular type of pruning. The end result is increased curb appeal. 

Crown or Canopy Cleaning:

This type of tree trimming is removing only unhealthy branches.

This is part of routine tree maintenance. All dead and diseased limbs are removed. 

Limbs too close together or with attachment points too close together are removed.
 
Crown or Canopy Thinning:

In crown thinning, the first step is to perform crown cleaning and then go on to

remove more branches with a focus on increasing aesthetics, improving light penetration,

improving air flow, improving visibility or a combination of the above. 

It is not recommended to remove more than 25% of the trees foliage producing limbs in one year.
 
Crown or Canopy Reduction:

Canopy reduction is used when a tree has outgrown its environment and cannot continue

to grow upward. This is most often due to interference with overhead utility lines and is

best done as part of a yearly maintenance program where a small portion is removed each year.

(Always less than 25%).
 
Tipping or Topping:

Topping is similar to canopy reduction except the reduction is often removal of nearly

100% of the foliage producing limbs. Tipping or topping is the last resource before

complete tree removal. Not all trees can withstand this type of pruning.   
 
Shaping or Training Young Trees:

Starting with young trees is the best way to prune. A little work in the first 5-10 years

of a tree’s life can save a lot of work later. Trees respond well to pruning when young

and can be trained towards a desired shape. When trees are really young you can focus

on shape and as they get older you can focus on removing branches that are

too close together or even rub against each other, as well as branches that

have weak unions. As stated earlier, it becomes more problematic to prune trees as they get older.
 
Application of Wound Dressing Paint:

When limbs are pruned properly (Not leaving a stub and not flush cutting too close to the trunk)

wound dressing should not be necessary. However, using a black wound dressing can

help aesthetics if several limbs are removed.
 
When to Prune:

The best time to prune most trees is late winter or early spring.

(Basically after winter’s worst but before they put on new growth.)

This is critical because if you wait until ornamental trees break dormancy

and begin to bud before pruning them you will be cutting off some of this year's blooms.

For that reason, some experts recommend pruning ornamental trees immediately after they bloom.

However, pruning outside the recommended time frame increases sap loss and the risk of infection.
 
Making Correct Pruning Cuts:

It is critically important when trimming larger limbs that you know where and how to cut them.

Where to cut involves not leaving a nub and not flush cutting into the branch collar.

Where the branch joins the tree in most types of tree there will be a noticeable collar.  

Stump Grinding:

What is stump grinding?

A stump grinding machine is a little bigger than a large lawn mower. It has a wheel

with sharp teeth that grind the stump into fine mulch. Stumps are ground 4-7" below

ground level. When finished, the mulch from the stump is raked back into the hole

where the stump was and in the place of a stump you have a small bed of mulch.

 Why you should consider stump grinding:

Removing stumps by cutting them out manually can be a back breaking and time consuming process.

Chemical treatments can speed the decomposition of the stump,

but this process can still take years to complete. Fires rarely get more than the surface of the wood,

and can cause legal headaches if they get out of control. With stump grinding, the entire process is complete within a few hours, and there are few (If any) possible complications,

Whether it is for clearing limbs and fallen trees after a storm or cutting trees to make room for a construction site, there is no shortage of demand for people who cut and remove trees. There is more to the business that just cutting down trees. To grow in the profession takes experience, skill and business acumen.

Learning the Trade

You only need a high school diploma to get started in a tree cutting and removing business. The training comes on the job, and will include learning about the composition of different trees, their diseases, and insects that destroy them. You will also learn safety requirements, tree-cutting techniques and the proper use of equipment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean wage for tree cutters was $33,850 in 2012. If you aspire to grow professionally, check with your state's department of agriculture to see what the requirements are to become a certified arborist.

Tree Removal Responsibilities

Tree removers are called on to clear trees from land being developed, to cut limbs threatening power lines, to remove fallen trees, and to provide general landscaping and pruning. You will use a variety of equipment, such as chippers, shredders, cables to assure that a tree falls in the right direction, hand saws, chain saws, climbing equipment and cherry pickers. In addition to cutting trees, you grind stumps down to ground level. If you trim branches, you protect the tree by covering the scars with tar. You may be called upon to identify and diagnose diseases, remove diseased limbs or rotted wood, and protect the remaining tree. When the cutting, grinding and chipping is done, you will need trucks large enough to remove the cut pieces.

Handling the Risks

Cutting trees poses numerous risks that can be avoided if you take the proper precautions. Tree cutters reach the limbs and top of trees either by climbing them or using a cherry picker -- essentially a man-sized bucket on the end of a hydraulic boom. Either way, you are high above the ground. If you are using a chain saw the risk of injury can be high, especially if you are climbing. You will need to use safety devices and exercise extreme caution. Many tree cutters are employed to trim limbs away from power lines, which can be hazardous or deadly if you come into contact with the lines or knock them down. In some cases it may be necessary to coordinate with your local electric company to temporarily shut off power while you cut branches.

The Business Side of Tree Removal

If you aspire to own your own business, you will need to learn how to run a company. To learn about running a business in general, you can learn from SCORE, the Small Business Administration, or the continuing education programs at a local college. Specific to your tree cutting and removal business, you will need to learn how to write and submit job estimates and how to manage a work crew. Due to the hazards of the business, you must have adequate insurance. You'll need to insure your workers against accidents, and have liability insurance for damage that may be incurred from falling limbs and trees.

Tree Removal- Beneficial for Secure Life!

Can trees be hazardous to us? It is a great topic to wonder!

Trees are the most beautiful part of our garden. They serve us with cool shade, striking scenic beauty and of course, a great place to spend time with our family and pets on hot summer days. Although there are thousands of benefits that we enjoy from trees, the trees can be dangerous to our lives and property.

You never know when a valuable tree falls down on your building or any person. It’s a risk! And this danger seems enlarged when it is concerned with the precious life of your beloved ones.

So, it is mandatory that you take care of your trees and keep a record of the health of the trees. This would make it easy and effortless for you to determine which tree would be a threat in next heavy rains!

Add these points to your checklist and make your surrounding more safe and secure:

Firstly, avoid planting those trees in your area whose parts are fragile. In case you have them in your backyard, don’t let children make that spot as their playground.

Ensure yourself that the branches of the trees do not lie nearby your house or any cable line. In these circumstances, there is a possibility that the branches fall on the roof of your sweet home or the wires and bring drastic results at the time of a calamity.

Dead limbs are like high alerts! They can fall anytime unexpectedly, even in the slightest breeze. Make sure that you remove the dead limbs before children climb in it and get hurt.

Examine if there is any cross or rub in branches. If yes, then pruning is necessary since crossing and rubbing leads to weak spots.

Keep an eye on the color, size and shape of the leaves. This would give you a clear idea whether the tree is healthy or not. Removal of an unhealthy tree is crucial.

Inspect the trunk of the tree. Is the tree growing with a forked trunk? The forked trunk signifies a potentially weak tree. The tree might be infected, weak and can die anytime.

If you find a fork growing outward rather than upward, get it pruned. This is good for both the tree and you.

If you find trees bending day by day, cut it out before it drops on you or your family.

The tree might appear healthy, but it can be weakened. Microorganisms like “the sneaky fungi” are active enough to weaken the supporting roots slowly and gradually from inside. It is thus your responsibility to check if the tree is going through any such situation. For this, check for “mushroom” nearby the bottom of the tree. If you find any root trouble, call the arborist immediately.

Avoid construction or trenching in the area of the root of a tree. Otherwise, the tree would get weaken and fall down on your property.

Keep your concern on the wounds, lighting scars, decays and cracks. Some cracks are normal, but some are so efficient that they can lead to breakage of the tree.

Try to examine and prune trees frequently. And also, use correct pruning methods. If you find it difficult to prune a tree, waste no time! Just call an Arborist and ask for Tree removal service.

This is the best way to get rid of unwanted, hazardous trees. The Arborists are well-equipped, professional and experienced. They have in-depth knowledge about different species of trees and ways to deal with each particular one. So, they can handle the situation better than an ordinary person especially when it is related to safety and time.

Remember, inspecting trees repeatedly and serving them with proper care can make them healthy and beneficial for you. Don’t let them become an emergency for you!

Benefits of Tree Trimming

Are your trees growing randomly in an uncontrollable manner? You could probably think of tree removal services. Yes, it is the most popular way to protect the tree that could probably destroy your property with its waywardly growth.

Nowadays, tree removal is no longer as tough a job as it once was. Tree care services are rising in popularity, and now we can remove dead or unneeded trees without a lot of difficulties. While there are several ways in which trees improve our homes and even our lives, an outgrowth of trees that are not in control and can threaten everything around them. This is why tree care and removal service companies can be beneficial for getting rid of these trees in the most effective manner possible.

There are some expert tips for tree trimming by professionals:

While trimming the ratio of living crown to tree height should be two-third.

The size of the branch that is to be removed is vital. Removing a branch less than five centimeters is fine.

The best time to prune a tree is during its dormant season. The only time not to prune is when the hazard exists.

Prune away branches when they are tender and small.

Don’t trim a branch too closely.

Trim branches that are weak and have close angles. Preserving strong branches is a good idea. 

Degrees of tree trimming:

Fine Pruning is cutting small limbs to improve the tree’s natural appearance.

Standard Pruning involves a bit more intricate cutting and is done to enhance the tree’s branch structure.

Hazard Trimming is suggested for trees that pose safety concerns. This typically involves eliminating branches that are two inches or more in diameter.

Crown Reduction Trimming usually involves the extraction of the main branches, and should only be done when there is significant dieback, wind damage, or when branches are hindering with power lines. In these cases, one should never remove more than one-third of the tree’s crown.
 
Benefits of Tree Trimming:

Aside from simple reasons like the tree’s shape and natural appearance, it can be tough to see why they would need to be pruned at all. But there are lots of ways that your trees can benefit from just a simple, fine pruning or an overall crown-reducing trim.

Improves the overall look and structure of the tree, restricting it from growing broad or weak branches. Trimming prevents limbs from developing with weak crotches, or eventually crossing each other and competing for space in the crown.

Proper trimming of your trees can improve their health by removing branches that are dead or dying. These branches are often dangerous, and eliminating them can reduce the risk of damage to your property and harm to your family. This will also prevent further decay.

Trees which grow and are not trimmed properly can also grow into power lines, which can create a risk of loss and further damage to lines. While most of the utility companies regularly trim around overhead lines on near public or streets, some require house owners to handle this task at their own expense for power lines spanning over private property.

Pruning fruit trees can improve the size and quantity of the crop. Fruit trees should be pruned in late winter to expose the center of the tree to sunlight and to give them a better shape.

Proper pruning can also lessen the weight of a tree, making it less likely to fall in a snowstorm or from the continuous strain of carrying a heavy load.
