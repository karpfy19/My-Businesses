7 Proven Ways to Market Your Painting Business

If you don’t have effective marketing, you don’t have a business. Every potential customer starts as a lead or prospect. Unfortunately, most marketing doesn’t work. But here are seven proven ways that have worked for our painting businesses, which are now generating $4 million in annual revenue in five states.

1. Door-to-door marketing

When you’re just starting, this is THE best way to start. A lot of people are afraid to do this, or don’t have the hustle to do it. Which means more leads for you! Basically, every hour you go door-to-door, you’ll get 1-2 painting leads. We’ve run hundreds of marketing teams to arrive at this number.

Pick neighborhoods that are higher income, that need paint. Or have HOA’s that require them to paint every 8-10 years. Here’s a simple effective script you can use:

“Hi, my name is Chandler from Painter Choice and I noticed you had a little peeling on your trim. Would you be interested in a free painting estimate?”

Most people will say no, but a few every hour will say yes!

You’ll want to set up a time later to actually do the estimate. Some people will expect you to do the estimate right then and there, but don’t do this unless they insist. You’ll have a much higher closing rate setting up a special time, when all the decision-makers are present for the bid.

2. Referrals

Referrals are the best leads. If you provide excellent service and quality, you’ll get a lot of referrals. A lot of contractors are unreliable, don’t communicate well, or do sloppy work. So if a previous customer recommends you, there’s a 90% chance you’ll win the job just by showing up.

3. Lead Providers

Lead providers are companies that specifically generate leads for your trade: painting, carpentry, etc. It works like this. A potential customer submits a request for an estimate online and you are sent their information with the project details. For example, “Barbara Johnson needs to paint the exterior of her home, her number is 303-xxx-xxxx.”

We use a few different lead providers for our painting companies:

Painter Choice

CraftJack

Thumbtack

HomeAdvisor is one of the larger lead providers but we’ve had mixed results with them.

With lead providers, you usually pay-per-lead, or set up a monthly budget and get a certain amount of leads. If the lead quality is good, you can usually turn about 70-80% of them into estimates. And then typically sell one out of three bids into an actual job.

You’ll want to track the return on investment with each lead-provider individually to see which ones work the best.

4. Lawn Signs

Lawn signs are one of the best investments you can make for your painting company.

As you’re painting a house, ask your client if you can put up a lawn sign with your company info in their front yard.

This is a GREAT way to get referrals because people can see your work in action. And if the customer allows it, you can leave the lawn sign up for months after it’s completed. You’ll get months of free advertising this way.

When designing your lawn sign, keep it simple. Keep in mind that most people cannot see any small details on your sign. Our lawn signs just have our logo and company name, with our phone number and “Get a Free Estimate” (a simple call-to-action).

5. Lead Groups

Some painters have incredible success with lead groups. These are specific business groups that have various professions/trades. People from different industries will get together once a month and exchange leads/referrals. I know one painter that gets 2-3 jobs a month JUST from his leads group. BNI is one example of a lead group, but you can also search online for other networking groups in your area.

6. Flyer Drops

We’ve had some success with flyer drops, but it can get expensive. For example, we dropped 5,000 flyers, got about 15 call-ins, and sold eight jobs, but the flyer drop cost us $2,000. We DID make a profit from the eight jobs we did, even though the advertising cost us a couple thousand.

It’s important to have an attractive flyer if you’re going to do a flyer drop. Too many people try and include everything imaginable about their company on one flyer. But imagine how much junk-mail/flyers you get already. You really only notice a couple of important headlines, so keep your flyers simple and clear, and include a special that encourages people to call in by a certain time. It’s important to create urgency with this kind of marketing.

7. Online Advertising (SEO, Directories)

I bet you get two calls a week asking if you’d like to “be on the first page of Google”. These are SEO companies promising the number one spot on Google for painting.

First off, you should avoid anyone who PROMISES to get you on the first page. SEO is very complicated and can take a while to get to the top. No one truly knows what spot you’ll be in, except Google.

Online directories: We’ve had success buying a banner ad with the BBB. We tried Yellow Pages but got zero results. Just google around and see what directories and sites show up; get on those.

Most online searches still happen through Google, so if you’re not on Google (or a site that shows up on Google) you probably won’t be found online.

Summary

It can be expensive to experiment with new marketing, so try the ones that work well first. Be very diligent in tracking your ROI. If you’re not tracking which sources produce the most business for you, your just making blind decisions and throwing money away.

How to Bid a Paint Job – A Free Guide to Estimating

I’ve painted houses for 11 years now and I still run into situations that are difficult to bid, but over time i’ve developed a simple process that can teach anyone to bid a painting job; exterior or interior.

There are really only 5 expenses to consider when estimating a paint job:

Paint

Materials

Labor

Marketing

Your Mark-up

That’s why I love painting businesses; they’re simple. I’ll break down each of these categories in detail.

1. How Much is Paint?

A gallon of paint can be anywhere from $15-80. It really depends on the brand, the quality and the contractor discount you’re getting.

A homeowner might be paying $30 for a gallon of paint, when a seasoned contractor can get the same gallon for $15. This depends on the relationship the contractor has with the paint store, and how many gallons they’re buying each month.

A personal example: When I first started, I was paying $37 per gallon of Sherwin Williams “Super Paint”. Over time, I developed a relationship with the store and proved that I was buying hundreds of gallons each month. After a couple years I negotiated my Super Paint price down to $25 per gallon.

From $37 to $25! That’s a big deal for my painting business: That’s 33% off my paint expenditure category.

The cost of paint also depends on the quality. A lower quality paint typically has less resin (the resin is what actually holds the paint together), whereas high quality paint has more resin and holds up better over time.

2. How Much are Materials?

These are the most common painting materials you’ll need on each job and how much you’ll need for a 2,500 square foot exterior paint job with medium prep work:

-Masking Plastic (2 rolls) $25

-Masking Paper (3 rolls) $15

-Tape (10 rolls) $35

-Caulking (6 tubes) $15

-Primer (1 gallon) $25

Total Cost: $115

How many materials you need also depends heavily upon:

Amount of prep-work needed

How many windows

How much brick

How much roof line

This checklist is pretty typical, but can vary greatly depending on the house.

If there is a LOT of prep needed, you might go through 3 gallons of primer, and 12 tubes of caulking.

If there is a LOT of brick + roof line that needs to be masked off, you might go through 5 rolls of paper and 3 rolls of plastic.

3. How Much is Labor?

This is by far the hardest cost to estimate when bidding a house, mainly because there are SO many factors.

The short answer is this; A good crew of 2-3 painters can finish the exterior of a 2,500 square foot house in 1-2 full days. And a good crew usually costs about $800 per full work day.

However, the following obstacles on a house can TRIPLE the time + labor it takes to paint a house:

Heavy Prep-work (peeling, wood damage, failed caulking)

House access (difficult ladder placements, steep roof etc.)

Type of windows (embedded windows, vinyl windows)

Vegetation coverage (trees in the way, lots of ivy, nice gardens)

Radically different colors (applying 2 or 3 coats before the paint covers)

The safest/best way to get a good price on labor is to actually bring your experienced crew to the house with you. They can alert you of certain aspects of the house that are very time-consuming, so you can factor in the extra work.

If you are inexperienced at painting or estimating, it is better to charge MORE in order to protect your profit margin. Making mistakes at the beginning is inevitable so charging more protects you against an underbid job or a missed expense.

Here’s a quick table to help you with labor cost:

1500 sq ft.

$800

2500 sq ft.

$1200

4. How Much is Marketing?

You can market your painting business a variety of ways, we have 7 proven methods here

No matter what you use for marketing, whether it’s lead providers, lawn signs or door-knocking, you should track the overall cost. It’s important to isolate the marketing that gives you the best ROI (return on investment) and spend all your time/money there.

Keeping your marketing percentage below 10% is a good rule-of-thumb. Let’s say you sell a $3,000 paint job. Spending $300 or less on marketing to obtain the job will still leave you plenty of profit.

Here are some typical marketing costs for our painting business:

Lead Providers – $30-$60 per lead

Lawn Signs – $10 per sign

Door-to-door leads – $10 per lead

Flyer Drops – $1,000-$4,000 per drop

Referrals – FREE

Lead Groups – FREE

5. Mark-up: How to factor in your profit.

You’re in business to make money right? And to provide the best dang paint job out there, so it’s important to add mark-up into your bid.

Let’s use our 2,500 square foot house as an example:

Paint – $375

Materials – $115

Labor – $1,200

Marketing – $100

Mark-up – ?

Let’s say I want to make 35% profit on this paint job. I’m spending $1,790 on paint, materials, labor and marketing.

So I should charge around $2800 total, which would make my mark-up $980.

6. Bidding Interior Jobs.

Interior jobs will almost always be more expensive. Sometimes they will be 2 or 3x the price of an exterior job. This is because:

There are more walls (and surface area)

More doors, windows, baseboards (don’t forget about closets)

Usually more than 1 coat is needed to cover (especially for ceilings)

More paint is needed

It is more of a detailed process for masking/cleanup etc. (more labor hours)

Some painters just charge per room; I’ve heard anywhere from $200 to $600 per room – which also depends on the size of the room.

Summary

I’ve used this basic formula for many years with success. Please keep in mind that it takes a lifetime to truly master painting, and there are an infinite number of obstacles and situations that house painting can create.

Some painters keep it simple and just charge by square foot; If you charge $1.25 per square foot, 2500 sq ft. would cost $3,125 for the homeowner etc. (for exterior). For interior you’ll want to charge $2 per square foot minimum.

Thankfully, almost every paint job will fall within the following pricing:

Exterior Paint Jobs:

1500 sq ft – $1,500-$2,500

3000 sq ft – $3,000-$5,000

5000 sq ft – $6,000-$8,000

Interior Paint Jobs:

1500 sq ft – $2,500-$3,500

3000 sq ft – $5,000-$8,000

5000 sq ft – $9,000-$12,000

Hiring Painters – How to Find Good Help

One of the biggest questions we get is “How do you find good help? Everyone I hire seems to be unreliable.”

This is a valid point. Many subcontractors are not reliable. They either show up late (or not at all) and their work is shoddy.

If you’re trying to grow your painting business, bad subcontractors can really put a wrench in your operation. You have to show up to the job site to make sure everything’s ok, or go to the paint store to get something they forgot. THEN you have to deal with an angry customer who’s not satisfied with the work.

There ARE reliable subcontractors out there. It’s just a matter of FINDING them and KEEPING them.

Here’s how we find good subs:

Craigslist Ads – We find almost all of our subs from craigslist. We post ads and then sift through A LOT of applications. We only contact about 10-20% of them. After that we show them a job and what we can pay out. If they feel our price is in the ballpark, we meet at the job and get to know each other and agree on a price.

For new subs we’re considering, we show up at the beginning of each day to make sure the work is going well. If they do a good job, we give them another one, and another one, until we have a good, reliable sub on our hands.

How do we pay them?

We aim for 50% INCLUDING materials. So the subcontractor actually goes and buys paint/materials for us. This leaves us enough gross profit to invest in other things like:

-Marketing our business

-Production management

-Insurance

-Taxes

How do we keep subs from stealing our jobs?

We make sure to put our company lawn signs at the job. Then we monitor it. If any of our subs poach a job, or try to, we don’t work with them again.

After a couple jobs, they see we’re a great source of work. Most subs will not risk stealing a job after seeing this.

We’ve found that 5-7 good painting subcontractors can produce $1,000,000 in a season.

There could still be problems and you might need to get rid of some people. But overall this system will secure a good core of subcontractors for you, opening up all your time to grow your painting business.
